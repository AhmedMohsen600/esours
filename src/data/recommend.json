This allows furniture owners to widen their artistic horizons and feel connected to their roots, all while being present in their current reality. We believe that every designer has a passion that shows their mark in any of their work. Our mark is demonstrated in the modern way of reviving the Arab heritage and presenting it in a manner that highlights originality, quality of details and simplification, as our designs reach loving homes in the best image.\n\nOur choice to use \"Iwan Kisra\" as the main inspiration was motivated by our desire to create modern designs with the essence of identity. The past couple of years witnessed a shift in consumer taste in the field of interior design and home furniture. Designs inspired by the Art Deco movement became trendy again and furniture owners expressed their desire in owning furniture pieces that contain Art Deco elements, such as geometric shapes, arches, and mixed materials.\n\nWe believe that Middle Eastern Arts and Architecture is a rich tapestry for inspiration. It contains design elements that inspired various movements that followed. Our motivation for designing \"Kisra\" was to find the original source for Art Deco design elements within Middle Eastern Art and Architecture. The façade composition of Iwan Kisra contains different sequences of rounded arches that proliferate the Art Deco movement. Furthermore, our research showed that Sasanians heavily relied on brass for their art and coins. Mixing different materials like wood and brass is one of the major elements of the Art deco aesthetic. By simply considering these different elements of Sasanian arts and architecture, we were able to develop a TV unit that is rich in identity and maintains a trendy, art deco look.\n\nThe Kisra TV unit exemplifies Maqam's values in highlighting Middle Eastern heritage and reviving local crafts in a contemporary fashion. The design is inspired by the historic architecture of one of the most mesmerizing landmarks in Iraq, “Iwan Kisra”. The television unit includes a shelving cabinet in the form of intersecting arches. The distributions of these arches, as well as dimensions reflect the design of Iwan Kisra's façade. The final design is a result of an extensive research and analysis process, which will be further discussed in the next statement.",
            "a2": "We believe that each time period has a different source of inspiration that has its own characteristics. Each of these eras include sources of strength and impact. By identifying a specific land mark for inspiration, we initiate a design process that takes into account each element of the era in which the landmark stood. This includes form, cultural context, arts, and materials. Furthermore, our design process includes analyzing spaces, destinations, or any geometric unit in a historic building.\n\nAs the Art Deco styles continue to rise in popularity, we wanted to create a trendy TV unit that has deeper cultural values. Art Deco is characterized by the abundance of shapes and the blended use of different materials such as wood and brass. The shapes of Art Deco are available in many historical designs, including Middle Eastern architecture. \n\nWe selected Iwan Kisra as our main inspiration for this project due to its historic and cultural significance. Its design follows the Sasanian Architectural style and contains the largest single-span vault of unreinforced brickwork in the world. The building was also mentioned in the famous poem of Al-Buhtury, in which he describes the beauty of Iwan Kisra and how it withstands the forces of time. Another reason for choosing Iwan Kisra for inspiration, was the repetitive use of rounded arches. Round arches are one of the main elements of Art Deco designs, which recently came back in trend.it\n\nFor the Kisra TV unit, we were inspired by the mesmerizing façade of Iwan Kisra. We analyzed different design elements of the architecture of the building, including the dimensions and sequencing of the arches for each floor. With each additional floor, one arch is added and the overall size of each arch shrinks by a certain ratio. For instance, the size of each arch in the first floor is half the size of the ones in the ground floor. While the size of the third floor arches is third the size of the ones in the ground floor (see façade design analysis in the photo submission).\n\nUsing the above ratios and sequencing, we created a basic motif of five arches, where smaller arches subset larger ones. We then created different iterations of this motif until we reached the final form for the Kisra television unit (See sketching of design iterations in the photo submission). The iterations followed basic guidelines of Sasanian Architecture, including repetition, centrality and descending sizes.\n\nIn addition to analyzing the architectural elements of Sasanian Architecture, we also researched the different elements of arts during that period. We identified brass as one the main materials used at the time and added it to Kisra's design in a contemporary way. This further reinforced the rich design mix of Kesra, as it connects two different styles, namely Sasanian and Art Deco.",

Surfaces were designed plain and smooth with slightly rounded edges. The appearance is accentuated with solid and transparent colors to accommodate all styles and spatial designs. The plain surfaces allow the user to use adhesive materials like stickers or wallpapers to change the design or style whenever needed. Moreover, Reblox designed the block with an open rooftop and side gates to facilitate any electrical installations.  \n\n The block has many specs and they are as follows:\n1. Sustainability.\nThe block is made out of recycled and recyclable plastic which can save tones of plastic that could have been thrown into oceans and seas. \n\n2. Endurance.\nThe brick is robust enough and heavy duty to last for long, while being flexible enough to be transformed or redesigned continuously.\n\n3. Thermal Resistance.\nReblox has a better thermal resistance factor compared to conventional materials in the market which can save up to 50% of the electricity used for air-conditioning due to its low thermal transmittance value.\n\n4. UV Resistant.\n Reblox resists the ultraviolet rays in the outdoor use which preserves the brick to last for long. \n\n5. Water Resistant.\nPlastic is not a porous material; therefore, it doesn’t absorb water and doesn’t cause any damage when being exposed to humidity.\n\n6.

Since Reblox is made out of recycling and recyclable plastic, it will reduce the waste by turning it into useful product. Besides, it emits zero Co2 during production which reduces the greenhouse gas. \n\nResidential, industrial, administrative and commercial sectors in Egypt consume 79% from the total energy produced. “http://www.moee.gov.eg/test_new/PDFReports/2018-2019AR.pdf p.84”.\nDue to some articles, air conditioners consume around 65% from total electricity. Accordingly, there is a need for thermal resistant walls to reduce the energy consumption for cooling.\n\nReblox walls save up to 15% from the energy consumption for cooling due to the cavity inside the block which works as thermal resistant. Furthermore, Reblox has developed a thermal resistant grade which is filled with foam to reduce the wall thermal transmittance factor (U-value: 0.2w/m2k).

It contains design elements that inspired various movements that followed. Our motivation for designing \"Kisra\" was to find the original source for Art Deco design elements within Middle Eastern Art and Architecture. The façade composition of Iwan Kisra contains different sequences of rounded arches that proliferate the Art Deco movement. Furthermore, our research showed that Sasanians heavily relied on brass for their art and coins. Mixing different materials like wood and brass is one of the major elements of the Art deco aesthetic. By simply considering these different elements of Sasanian arts and architecture, we were able to develop a TV unit that is rich in identity and maintains a trendy, art deco look.\n\nThe Kisra TV unit exemplifies Maqam's values in highlighting Middle Eastern heritage and reviving local crafts in a contemporary fashion. The design is inspired by the historic architecture of one of the most mesmerizing landmarks in Iraq, “Iwan Kisra”. The television unit includes a shelving cabinet in the form of intersecting arches. The distributions of these arches, as well as dimensions reflect the design of Iwan Kisra's façade. The final design is a result of an extensive research and analysis process, which will be further discussed in the next statement.",
            "a2": "We believe that each time period has a different source of inspiration that has its own characteristics. Each of these eras include sources of strength and impact. By identifying a specific land mark for inspiration, we initiate a design process that takes into account each element of the era in which the landmark stood. This includes form, cultural context, arts, and materials. Furthermore, our design process includes analyzing spaces, destinations, or any geometric unit in a historic building.\n\nAs the Art Deco styles continue to rise in popularity, we wanted to create a trendy TV unit that has deeper cultural values. Art Deco is characterized by the abundance of shapes and the blended use of different materials such as wood and brass. The shapes of Art Deco are available in many historical designs, including Middle Eastern architecture. \n\nWe selected Iwan Kisra as our main inspiration for this project due to its historic and cultural significance. Its design follows the Sasanian Architectural style and contains the largest single-span vault of unreinforced brickwork in the world. The building was also mentioned in the famous poem of Al-Buhtury, in which he describes the beauty of Iwan Kisra and how it withstands the forces of time. Another reason for choosing Iwan Kisra for inspiration, was the repetitive use of rounded arches. Round arches are one of the main elements of Art Deco designs, which recently came back in trend.it\n\nFor the Kisra TV unit, we were inspired by the mesmerizing façade of Iwan Kisra. We analyzed different design elements of the architecture of the building, including the dimensions and sequencing of the arches for each floor. With each additional floor, one arch is added and the overall size of each arch shrinks by a certain ratio. For instance, the size of each arch in the first floor is half the size of the ones in the ground floor. While the size of the third floor arches is third the size of the ones in the ground floor (see façade design analysis in the photo submission).\n\nUsing the above ratios and sequencing, we created a basic motif of five arches, where smaller arches subset larger ones. We then created different iterations of this motif until we reached the final form for the Kisra television unit (See sketching of design iterations in the photo submission). The iterations followed basic guidelines of Sasanian Architecture, including repetition, centrality and descending sizes.\n\nIn addition to analyzing the architectural elements of Sasanian Architecture, we also researched the different elements of arts during that period. We identified brass as one the main materials used at the time and added it to Kisra's design in a contemporary way. This further reinforced the rich design mix of Kesra, as it connects two different styles, namely Sasanian and Art Deco.",

Surfaces were designed plain and smooth with slightly rounded edges. The appearance is accentuated with solid and transparent colors to accommodate all styles and spatial designs. The plain surfaces allow the user to use adhesive materials like stickers or wallpapers to change the design or style whenever needed. Moreover, Reblox designed the block with an open rooftop and side gates to facilitate any electrical installations.  \n\n The block has many specs and they are as follows:\n1. Sustainability.\nThe block is made out of recycled and recyclable plastic which can save tones of plastic that could have been thrown into oceans and seas. \n\n2. Endurance.\nThe brick is robust enough and heavy duty to last for long, while being flexible enough to be transformed or redesigned continuously.\n\n3. Thermal Resistance.\nReblox has a better thermal resistance factor compared to conventional materials in the market which can save up to 50% of the electricity used for air-conditioning due to its low thermal transmittance value.\n\n4. UV Resistant.\n Reblox resists the ultraviolet rays in the outdoor use which preserves the brick to last for long. \n\n5. Water Resistant.\nPlastic is not a porous material; therefore, it doesn’t absorb water and doesn’t cause any damage when being exposed to humidity.\n\n6. Fire Resistant.\nReblox has developed a grade resistant to fire. This grade doesn’t make ignition by exposing to fire. The grade was tested and certified due to UL94_V0 standard. \n\n7.

Since Reblox is made out of recycling and recyclable plastic, it will reduce the waste by turning it into useful product. Besides, it emits zero Co2 during production which reduces the greenhouse gas. \n\nResidential, industrial, administrative and commercial sectors in Egypt consume 79% from the total energy produced. “http://www.moee.gov.eg/test_new/PDFReports/2018-2019AR.pdf p.84”.\nDue to some articles, air conditioners consume around 65% from total electricity. Accordingly, there is a need for thermal resistant walls to reduce the energy consumption for cooling.\n\nReblox walls save up to 15% from the energy consumption for cooling due to the cavity inside the block which works as thermal resistant. Furthermore, Reblox has developed a thermal resistant grade which is filled with foam to reduce the wall thermal transmittance factor (U-value: 0.2w/m2k).
