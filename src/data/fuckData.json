            "a1": "We believe that drawing inspiration from heritage, and presenting it in modern lines, turns furniture into distinctive pieces that integrate ancient civilizations with our modern times. This allows furniture owners to widen their artistic horizons and feel connected to their roots, all while being present in their current reality. We believe that every designer has a passion that shows their mark in any of their work. Our mark is demonstrated in the modern way of reviving the Arab heritage and presenting it in a manner that highlights originality, quality of details and simplification, as our designs reach loving homes in the best image.\n\nOur choice to use \"Iwan Kisra\" as the main inspiration was motivated by our desire to create modern designs with the essence of identity. The past couple of years witnessed a shift in consumer taste in the field of interior design and home furniture. Designs inspired by the Art Deco movement became trendy again and furniture owners expressed their desire in owning furniture pieces that contain Art Deco elements, such as geometric shapes, arches, and mixed materials.\n\nWe believe that Middle Eastern Arts and Architecture is a rich tapestry for inspiration. It contains design elements that inspired various movements that followed. Our motivation for designing \"Kisra\" was to find the original source for Art Deco design elements within Middle Eastern Art and Architecture. The façade composition of Iwan Kisra contains different sequences of rounded arches that proliferate the Art Deco movement. Furthermore, our research showed that Sasanians heavily relied on brass for their art and coins. Mixing different materials like wood and brass is one of the major elements of the Art deco aesthetic. By simply considering these different elements of Sasanian arts and architecture, we were able to develop a TV unit that is rich in identity and maintains a trendy, art deco look.\n\nThe Kisra TV unit exemplifies Maqam's values in highlighting Middle Eastern heritage and reviving local crafts in a contemporary fashion. The design is inspired by the historic architecture of one of the most mesmerizing landmarks in Iraq, “Iwan Kisra”. The television unit includes a shelving cabinet in the form of intersecting arches. The distributions of these arches, as well as dimensions reflect the design of Iwan Kisra's façade. The final design is a result of an extensive research and analysis process, which will be further discussed in the next statement.",
            "a2": "We believe that each time period has a different source of inspiration that has its own characteristics. Each of these eras include sources of strength and impact. By identifying a specific land mark for inspiration, we initiate a design process that takes into account each element of the era in which the landmark stood. This includes form, cultural context, arts, and materials. Furthermore, our design process includes analyzing spaces, destinations, or any geometric unit in a historic building.\n\nAs the Art Deco styles continue to rise in popularity, we wanted to create a trendy TV unit that has deeper cultural values. Art Deco is characterized by the abundance of shapes and the blended use of different materials such as wood and brass. The shapes of Art Deco are available in many historical designs, including Middle Eastern architecture. \n\nWe selected Iwan Kisra as our main inspiration for this project due to its historic and cultural significance. Its design follows the Sasanian Architectural style and contains the largest single-span vault of unreinforced brickwork in the world. The building was also mentioned in the famous poem of Al-Buhtury, in which he describes the beauty of Iwan Kisra and how it withstands the forces of time. Another reason for choosing Iwan Kisra for inspiration, was the repetitive use of rounded arches. Round arches are one of the main elements of Art Deco designs, which recently came back in trend.it\n\nFor the Kisra TV unit, we were inspired by the mesmerizing façade of Iwan Kisra. We analyzed different design elements of the architecture of the building, including the dimensions and sequencing of the arches for each floor. With each additional floor, one arch is added and the overall size of each arch shrinks by a certain ratio. For instance, the size of each arch in the first floor is half the size of the ones in the ground floor. While the size of the third floor arches is third the size of the ones in the ground floor (see façade design analysis in the photo submission).\n\nUsing the above ratios and sequencing, we created a basic motif of five arches, where smaller arches subset larger ones. We then created different iterations of this motif until we reached the final form for the Kisra television unit (See sketching of design iterations in the photo submission). The iterations followed basic guidelines of Sasanian Architecture, including repetition, centrality and descending sizes.\n\nIn addition to analyzing the architectural elements of Sasanian Architecture, we also researched the different elements of arts during that period. We identified brass as one the main materials used at the time and added it to Kisra's design in a contemporary way. This further reinforced the rich design mix of Kesra, as it connects two different styles, namely Sasanian and Art Deco.",

            "a1": "The issue of crafts going obsolete, or not reaching their utmost potential in Egypt/ Middle East is a very big and multi layered topic. \nFor the sake of simplifying now, I intend to share my approach and take on it. \nCraftsman a few decades ago were their own Artists, they created their own designs and expressed it through their craftsmanship. The idea of Design did not exist as we know it now, With the rise of Design and Product Design practices evolving very fast with design trends, has made the outcomes/work of the craftsmen on its own not relatable to us with our modern day. Why would a timeless craft like glass blowing die? The same goes with crafts like Arabesque, pearl inlaying, brass hammering, etc. Their products/outcome’s aesthetical values are what I believe to be out of date decades ago, and not necessarily relatable to our modern day. This is where I believe the craft is stuck, and this is where I believe the role of the designer comes in to find new innovative ways to bridge this gap. \nExploring and developing dialogue between designer and craftsmanship has been the core essence in all my work process.\nHow a traditional craft lends itself to a new aesthetic, how a traditional material could be utilized by new technology, how the craft/technique of one material can be used on another material. My design process and objects are an on-going exploration that combines my love for materials, passion for workmanship and celebration of the poetry in light. \n\nBy having a good understanding, and a hands on approach with the craft production, I am able to reinterpret and apply the craft in a way to create new exciting unique contemporary products. Thus reintegrating and reintroducing the craft again into our homes, lives, and spaces. \n\nIntroducing Float:\nFloat is an exploration of a new lighting technique. The idea was to create a truly unique light imprint on space, reflected from the sublimely imperfect hand- hammered brass canopy. Between a “floating” surface and an up-light source; the result is a sense of mystery and interplay between light, traditional technique and lighting technology. The Light effect can be altered through an adjustable custom-built LED mini projector.",
            "a2": "The idea behind float is celebrating and reinterpreting the traditional hand hammering technique through a  soft, dreamy, artistic, modern and dynamic experience. I envisioned seeing soft reflections and imprints of hammering all around the space with a magical anonymous sense of not knowing where it really came from.\n\nI started by testing different patterns of hand hammering techniques and seeing how their imprints responded to light.  Along with this was the form development of the actual canopy which would reflect and bounce light of it. I wanted to create a form that was large/oversized yet still felt so light and airy.  After experimentations between form and light, I ended up using the softest hammering imprints as it gave the canopy a more uninterrupted sense to its fluidity. The soft imprints also created a more subtle visual, thus enhancing the mystical sense of not seeing the source of the patterns. \n\nWith regards to the development of the light source, there were several aspects to consider. The light source needed to be a strong and directional one so it would hit the canopy and reflect the hammering effect. The beam angle and strength of light greatly determined how the reflections looked like. \nThe light source also needed to be compact in size to remain slick, subtle, and minimal in comparison to the canopy.\nMost importantly, the light source needed to remain hidden. \nAfter lengthy experimentations with several light mockups, I developed a custom made projector with a LED factory to offer the optimum light effect with these attributes. A special lens was integrated in the light projector to direct the light more efficiently onto the plate (to avoid light loss). The projector is adjustable to go up and down, therefore allowing adjustment and control on the light pattern.  \n\nSpecial care was taken while specifying the remaining accessories/fittings. The use of a thin Coaxial cable to suspend the fixture enhanced the floating feeling on the plate as it is nearly invisible from a distance.   ( A coaxial cable is a cable  characterized by its thin and slick aesthetic and that holds both the electrical wires and the metal suspension wire in one cable); All remaining fittings were made to be as compact and minimal as possible leaving the focus only on the plate and projector body.",

The module is a certain closed-form that can be used as a table by placing a glass panel or an alternative to the glass, and then by pulling one side of that shape, the shape is separated in half, the table becomes an open and closed chair and the table can be adjusted to its height. I've modified the design more than once to make sure that it can be implemented and make sure that there are some design requirements, such as ease of use and user experience, as well as not taking into account the kinetic aspects of dimensions and other factors, as well as trying to make the product usable in many places.",

Research has shown that overproduction is supply over demand, in which leads to an abundant waste of resources, it has also been predicted that the roots of the problem is moral education. The aim of the project is to intervene in the production process in order to minimize the abundant waste by increasing the sustainability value. Building on a newly formulated research question, asking: How can the product be utilized for longer sustainability in order to avoid overproduction, while also coping with the speed of advancement in both the technology and the user’s needs? Based on the research methodology, involvement with applied, explanatory and inductive goals were successfully grasped by comprehensively analyzing a wide variety of secondary data. Analysis of data proved that utilizing the practicality of humanism and the critical managing of approaches such as life cycle assessment, methodical design, circular industrial economy and timeless design principles would accomplish a high-rate of sustainability that would have accomplished high personal value and timeless functionality. On this basis, it is indicated that the material rice-straw has been examined as a knitted packaging material in the case study, upholding great results towards the project’s goal.",
            "a2": "Speed of advancement in production is a global issue. Although it is challenging to perceive such a topic, digging deeper into it and knowing the reasons behind it would be quite interesting. I hope to achieve a big step towards my goal in improving people's lives. Since production plays a huge factor in human evolution, as production originated from the beginning of time. It started from simple tools using rocks to cut trees or harvest fruits and vegetables, reaching to the manufacturing of power stations that generates energy for numerous usages. Power stations generate the energy needed for the production process. However, this energy used for production is limited, as materials are limited. There are different methods of generating energies which can be divided into two major sources. Non-renewable energy sources, like fossil fuel, coal, nuclear and natural gas. And renewable energy sources, like solar, hydropower, biomass, wind, and geothermal. According to British Petroleum’s statistical reviews of World Energy in 2019, the usage of renewable energy is only about 15.29%, while the rest is non-renewable energy sources. There is also a huge amount of energy wasted in the production process. As this process starts with the extraction of material in nature, then storing it, shipping it, using it to produce goods and services, consuming it, and finally recycling it. At each stage of the process, an amount of energy has to be used into the good or service to push it to the next stage of what it becomes. Therefore, in order for the extracted material to reach the next stage which is storage, an amount of energy is needed for this cycle. In each cycle of this conversion, part of the energy is lost. On another standpoint, there are also some materials that cannot be recycled after consumption. In this situation, corporates try their best to stay up to date with the advancement; by utilizing their Research & Development departments. Accordingly, newer products are introduced to the market on a fast pace. So, overproduction of goods occurs; risking the insufficient resources of the planet. It had always been an intriguing question knowing how the world would be affected if overproduction decreased! \n\nThe research methodology is a contribution of applied, explanatory and inductive categories. In which, an applied research is aimed at improving products, methods and procedures, while the goal of explanatory research is explaining a clear problem’s causes and consequences, and a inductive research is dedicated on developing a new concept associated with the research findings. The next step would be approaching the research data process. The project’s plan is to utilize secondary data which has already been collected by other researchers and designers. In addition, it would be a concentration on a mixed research method of both qualitative and quantitative types as it would focus on both meanings and statistics. To sum up, the aim of this project is to intervene in a stage of the production process to solve the problem of overproduction with product design principles.",

            "a1": "Around the mid-19th century, luxury Egyptian tobacco brands and accessories spread out across the world. Egyptian products were not known for their high quality only, but the mysterious Egyptian history exaggerated the desire to possess them. The time passed, and the passion faded, but the mystery remained and waited patiently to be wrapped with elegance one more time. The “BC³” represents a revival trail for the desire for Egyptian tobacco products through a Contemporary Vision of a Multifunctional Cigar Smoking Collection. The Egyptian visual artists usually express Egypt in the form of a peasant woman, as a gratitude for her rule through history, and to appreciate her extraordinary ability to adapt and overcome problems calmly. Accordingly, to present an Egyptian Cigar Smoking Collection in the form of an art piece, there is no better way than being inspired by the mental image of the Egyptian peasant woman. She always stands straight with perfect body lines and dynamic curves, carrying the Nile water in a pottery jar above her head while dressed up in a unique black Tally dress inlaid with silver threads.",

The entire realization process started with the preliminary studies and sketches, which focused on analyzing and extracting the proper sculpture lines inspired by the Egyptian Peasant Woman. Next was the construction material selection, which needed to be durable, replaceable, reusable, recyclable, and above all, can reflects the unique texture, patterns, and colors of the \"Tally Fabric.\" After that was the generation of the virtual prototype, which depended on a parametric design software with a unique script generated by the designer, to select the proper binder clips sizes and numbers for each sub-piece and the whole sculpture. Then, it was the time for constructing the semi-final prototype and testing its functionality performance, where the final amendments and adjustments took place, and finally, it was the time to collect the “BC³” sculpture into its final configuration.",

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), metal binder clips are 100% recyclable and biodegradable products compared to plastic ones. In addition to their unique environmental properties, binder clips are durable and reusable products, which means that after a long time of using it as a cigar-smoking collection, the user can disassemble the “BC³” for the last time to use the Binder Clips for their original function. The Stick-on Floor Protectors, which are used on connection points on sculpture and sub-pieces to protect them from slipping or scratching the surfaces, were selected to contain more than 70% recycled polyester to low the environmental impact.",

On one side, using it as a Sculpture represents a contemporary piece of art that can add a decorative touch to any modern theme or context. On the other side, using “BC³” as a cigar-smoking collection provides its owner with all the necessary pieces for a unique smoking experience. The fact that the final sculptural configuration shows no adhesive materials or permanent connections maximizes the dynamism and shape-shifting of the sculpture. The disassembling and reassembling processes depend only on the owner’s hand power to perform a Press and Release action on the Binders Handles. With the appropriate instructions, the owner can master both processes to take only 5 minutes.",

            "q6": "Besides selecting the Egyptian Peasant Woman as a theme to inspire the final \"BC3\" configuration and using Binder Clips as a durable construction material that can mimic the Tally Fabric, two main unconventional factors make “BC³” a unique product. The first factor is the construction technique, which depends on combining the Binder Bodies into the necessary sub-pieces via vis-versa interlocking and then uses the Binders Handles as construction tension members to collect the sub-pieces into the final configuration. The other factor focuses on the smoking experience itself, which usually ends by keeping the cigar-smoking pieces and accessories on the table or within a box; with the “BC³,” the owner can reassemble them back together to enjoy his unique piece of art once more.",

There are distractions, from chores to pets, that you used to leave behind when you “went to work.” It’s also difficult to develop, and stick to, a new routine.\nSo a new type of furniture is needed to help and ease the operation of “working from home” , also according to our small spaces for living , the furniture now days preferable to be a space-saving units , also a multifunctional one.\n The main problem the design trying to solve is to providing a a multifunctional piece and a space saving one that uses less space and is often transformable , meaning it provides more than one function. Space saving furniture is usually more innovative , modern in style and designed to accommodates smaller living areas.\nThe first functionality of the piece is providing a proper storage for the art suppliers , which any art student or any designers uses in his daily life that causes the place to be messy as the markers , pencil colors , pens and so many other staff that we designers uses.\n Also a place for the rolled long papers , which the art students and designers uses in abundance , and don't how to store them properly so they will not be harmed because of the poor storage .\nIt also provide another type of drawers for the storage of sketch books, note books  a box of pastel colors..etc, and the piece is not only for storage but also it can use as a study desk , and it's dimensions fits the huge papers that the students and the designers uses in the big projects, so it can be used as an engineering table , so it's a multifunctional piece that solves all the problems that anyone in the art field faces when it comes to designing.\nThe style used is \"DE Stijl \" style ,it’s Dutch for ‘the style’ and the name of a radical minimalist art movement founded in The Netherlands in 1917. Co-founder Piet Mondrian was probably its most famous member. Much of our modern love of open-plan living and geometric furniture comes straight out of the experiments of De Stijl. \nIt was highly influential in furniture design, architecture, painting, sculpture and even literature – which is as well, because they advocated close collaboration between all art forms – and it inspired many well-known 20th century designers, including Miles van der Rohe.\nAnd the statement \"ART SEVES ART\" means that the concept used in the colors and lines of the design which inspired from \"DE STIJL \" which an \"art\" movement , which serves the piece of furniture that made for an 'art' purpose . \nso to sum up we can say that the design aims are :\n-Designing a space saving office to integrate with nowadays space living.\n-Organizing most of the art and office suppliers in one piece.\nTarget audience: Artists / art students / engineering students / and any one in the engineering field",

Our force to adapt to this lifestyle is influencing our choices even when people start furnishing their homes.\n\n\nWe recently noticed that a lot of homes are modern and mostly look alike. That is because they are not done by the choices of house owners yet delegated to firms, which is not something bad but it’s the trend that lead to identityless look n feel homes. On the other hand, consumers when come across a modern authentic design, they stop and shop. That is the driver that contributed to the success of Egyptian brands like Azza Fahmy, Joud, and many more local brands. \n\nAgain, this new lifestyle we are living in 2021 created a need for taste and art. It also created an appreciation for identity at home. Local brands started to flourish and consumers adopted a product with their identity when it was designed with an accent of the world they are living in. As a result of the love of art flourishing it became an important element in networking events acting as an icebreaker. This is exactly why we chose dining setups products to tap on reaching our vision and mission because where do people network? What products do they they use or can create a look n feel to make their network unique? At Casa Mia we find that the dining table setup creates all the mood and is an important pillar. That is why we created a product authentically designed yet modern.\n\nSo we tapped on two key players in all homes to try to spread our vision and mission through, which are kids bedrooms and dinning tables. But not dining tables as furniture, it is the dining setup that speaks most in all hospitality setups.\n\n\nLets tell you the story about our tablecloths and how significant they are as a product before answering your self evaluation questions.\n\n\nOur tablecloths are our tool in spreading a authenticity/identity at homes. So we chose Abdeen palace as our inspiration for one of our collection. As it is full of art from different historical eras for egypt like Byzantine patterns, Mamluk pattern, Islamic patterns, European patterns and many more. Egypt learnt art from different nationalities, it was a cosmopolitan country so we have lovely patterns and lines earned over many years to show the world.",

In addition my cousin published a book reciting the architecture and interior of the palace as I read it I fell in love with the art in it especially when I read that it was done based on intentional artistic display of Egyptian era. A hall with Byzantine art, neo-Islamic (al haramlek), jardin d’hiver, from here I started reading about the patterns history and started to combine patterns and diffuse it to create new ones in a modern context. I sketch the pattern with its proportions on the table manually first then I scan it on photoshop and start applying it to create the final product to be printed on cloth.\nAnother research we did is the material used. We had several fabrics options and weight, as fabrics vary in weight as well. We chose a material that fits modern lifestyle which is “fast” easy to wash and iron, doesn’t require too much effort.\nLast step in the product development was the packaging how will it be delivered to the customer and the branding we want putting in mind being environmentally friendly. So we chose paper bags and paper boxes in addition to a card stating the story of the design, so we can spread the heritage and art among our society.",

Thats why when we sell the tablecloth we write its story so it could act like a piece of art hung on the wall and by that achieve our primary goal is heritage in an artisanal way. \nThat’s why we chose the dining table, the most element that witnesses networking in the house.In modern houses clients used the tablecloth for the buffet table acting it as a decorative and centerpiece of the event.\nThis product can impact the F&B business for dining in an artisanal way.\nThe material used is heavy duty for several usages, washes and  hot serving as well as the design is creating the objective of the product which is spreading authenticity in a contemporary and artisanal way. consequently setting a unique mood for a hospitality with a story to offer for attendees. For example when you have a piece of art hung on the wall you it acts like an ice breaker for the event and creates harmony in the event. Our tablecloths achieve this by testimonials by clients. As, we offer the story of the pattern when purchased in the package. Nevertheless, there is always room for expanding, and improvement in design to reach more clients.",

            "q6": "What’s creative about this product the patterns design and the  choice of one piece of furniture to do the talking, the vehicle in spreading art. Our tablecloths are sold with card stating the story behind the design as a help for the client to spread the word.\nAlso, the creativity here is in the combination of several patterns in the palace from several places in creating the final design exactly like a piece of drawing. In addition to the choice of combining it with runners of a totally different pattern from a different place in the palace to tell more stories about our lines that we learnt across history.\nLast but not least the element of keeping the hand drawing look and feel on photoshop was hard to implement.\nAs you can see our logo is a typography and flowers drawn with a paint brush because the brand identity is all about appreciating  art and craft be it old or modern. Even when we designed the tablecloths we drew it by hand and turned it digital I kept the lines not perfectly drawn or sharp like computer does so as to be consistent with brand identity. Therefore the images we were keen to be consistent with is the hand paint look and we took into consideration the colors to be adapting to the globalized world\nThough these designs are inspired by real art but there is room to abstract these designs further.\n\nIn our current age of mass production, group think, and homogenized globalization, a lot of people can copy but oddly enough (since we really are all unique), not many people can produce work with a unique voice.\nI believe our product is unique because tackling a heritage that hasn’t been highlighted and using its art in a modern setup.\n\nAlso using patterns in the palace that rarely someone can notice. Like a special part in a chandelier combined with the glass window pattern. So not only we were inspired by the artifact and an art that is already there but we did a combination of lines to produce a unique pattern and design.",
            "q7": "Yes",
            "q8": "We used to photoshop and scanning to transfer a hand drawn sketch to computer so as to print it. It’s a simple process yet with too many details to reach the look you want.\nThe photoshop could have influenced the look of hand drawn but we managed to keep the lines not straight so as to give the effect of drawing. So we mastered the computer influence. This process might take weeks.\nWe keep printing the final design several times for touches and try several color palettes specifically computer printing versus production printing. For colors they differ big time in the look you want to deliver. Sometimes on the printer it’s great but on the fabric it’s not and vice versa.\nLast step that was tricky to be applied skillfully were the colors in printing versus computer and type of fabric. We had to print on many fabrics and different weight of fabrics to reach to this product at the moment. But all the fabrics are locally produced.\nWe even have the runners on a different fabric type and thickness other than the tablecloths.",

The Latin derivative for the word emotion, ‘emotere’, literally means energy in motion.\n\nIn itself, emotional energy is neutral. It is the feeling sensation and physiological reaction that makes a specific emotion positive or negative. In the painting it is represented either a negative or positive wave. Feeling is what you label as anger, sadness, joy or fear. It is then your interpretations or thoughts about emotional energy that give it meaning. \n\nEmotion serves as the carrier waves for the entire spectrum of feelings. Understanding that emotions are energy implies that they are fluid, moving resources meant to be felt and released vs. suppressed and ignored. The latter is the true culprit of low emotional intelligence and stress burnout.\n\nAs a result of these findings, the emotional brain is considered to have executive power in the brain. It influences all decision making, thought processes, memories, and present experiences. Your ability to understand, deal with, and effectively use your emotional energy is vital to your happiness levels.\n\nThe sensations you feel in your body hold the key to unlocking limiting patterns, transforming stress, and generating lasting happiness. Your body gives a constant stream of reliable information about your experience in the form of sensation. It’s a library of who you are at the deepest level, including all that has happened to you and all that you dream about. Understanding your body sensations will transform your life\nThe drive to move your emotional energy is present every moment because your nervous system is in constant pursuit of homeostasis. It’s on a mission 24/7 regulating the balance of your bodymind connection. This often includes your instinctual drive to be happy by releasing any pent-up stress. You have an opportunity to move your emotional energy each time you experience contraction, tension, or any other body sensations. They are the internal messages of your bodymind wisdom that draw you toward balance and happiness.\nGiven the understanding that emotion is actually energy in motion it is important to distinguish what it looks and feels like to increase your emotional awareness. Most people believe this looks like using their thinking mind to analyze, think about and talk about how they feel. Although this approach can bring initial awareness it is not effective in the long run. It is common from this approach to hinder the process of expressing and managing emotions. In doing so, it keeps the process of expression at the level of thought vs. actual feeling or energy movement. In order to successfully express emotion you have to move your emotional energy by identifying the sensations and releasing states of contraction.\nThe ability to feel a certain feeling and just move on to the other feeling without overthinking it, let it flow because the second you think about it, it drives from energy in motion to an emotion, then to a thought, then to a spoken word. You never need to underestimate the power of a spoken word.  Death and life are in the power of the tongue and those who love it will eat its fruit. What I am full of, my mouth will say. Speak blessings, your will should be aware that you have power in your words. Words are like seeds, and they grow with you subconsciously like a tree, that will sooner or later produce fruits.  \n\n“Let there be light, and there was light. – God said”",

People keep plants in their homes not only for aesthetic reasons but also because they evoke positive feelings and a happier state of mind.\n֍\tUnfortunately, some of us still have trouble taking care of plants; simply because they can’t talk our language to tell us their needs, which seems like it requires a sort of special sense or knowledge to understand their needs just by looking at them. Does she need more water or was the water too much? Was there no sunlight? Is her type requires indoor or outdoor caring conditions? Is a bigger suitable pot needed as she grows up? Are there any chewing insects or invading enemies? Does she suffer from pain or stress? Why did she not survive? These are all questions that many of us have had at one point in time or another and this is precisely what “Wesal” is trying to solve.\n֍\tWesal introduces the unique personality of each plant, representing plants with real funny characters.\n֍\tWesal creates a conversational mode, giving the chance to this seemingly mundane creature to express her feelings, to ask for attention if you have not paid attention to it for a while, and to react when spoken to with a cute face and expressive voice.\n֍\tWesal surrounds each personified plant with her perfect environment, providing her with all essential and supplementary conditions for healthy growing; from watering, minerals, lighting, pH levels and temperature, to surrounding her with entertaining and calming music.\n֍\tWesal aims to prove that plant is the best friend for us from kids to elders, lonely or social, busy or free-scheduled, lacking a green thumb or gardening professionals.\n֍\tWesal aims also to enhance people behaviour with morals as the plant rises in front of them; such as Mercy, Beauty of caring, giving unconditionally, sustaining our green ecosystem with gratitude for precious gifts: water, Sun, and Mother Earth.",
            "a2": "My product began with an imaginative idea as I was talking to my recuperating plant, then wondering: Oh! Did she hear me? Oh! Did she reply to my words? Oh! Did she feel my sadness when she was sick?; Yes, I’m sure she does. But how can I prove it?\n֍\tSo I began to research and found several studies showing that researchers have been able to document plant sounds using sensors and electrodes. They have found different responses when they are in pain or thirsty.\n֍\tSome biological studies indicate that plants are highly sensitive organisms that generate and react to sound signals from their environment.\n֍\tExperiments found that specific frequencies of bee buzzing facilitate the pollination of flowers. In addition, recorded insect chewing sounds induce the production of chemicals related to plant defence. So, plants respond to insects through sound, either serving as warning signals or beneficial signals to the plant.\n֍\tHowever, the specific organs or proteins used for sound perception have not yet been identified, cutting-edge technology now believes that plants can indeed benefit from sound through their mechanosensory machinery. \n֍\tRecent studies using ‘omics’ technologies, such as transcriptome and proteomic analyses, showed that proper sound treatment has a positive effect on plant growth, as they exhibit transcriptional and hormonal changes in response to sound wave treatment.\n֍\tPlant hormones typically regulate plant cellular processes and orchestrate most aspects of plant physiology including plant growth, flowering, ripening, senescence, and defence responses, sound-induced hormonal changes might increase plant growth and provide strong resistance against biotic or abiotic stress. \n֍\tResearch by South Korea’s National Institute of Agricultural Biotechnology shows that: plants begin to react to sound at 70 decibels. Lucky for us, 70 decibels is the sound level for the average human conversation. Speaking, playing music and natural sound waves and vibrations provided from the environment all play a part in stimulating growth in our plants. \n֍\tIn a study conducted by the Royal Horticultural Society, research demonstrated that plants did respond to human voices\n֍\tBased on these different researches: Scientists developed an artificial sound treatment called Ultrasonication, this sonication treatment is fast, energy-saving, water-saving, also can elicit various effects in plants:\n1) Enhancement of seed germination percentage, seed vigour index (SVI), root and shoot lengths of seedlings, better plant growth and higher crop yields.\n2) Sound pretreatment enhances plant immunity against subsequent pathogen attacks by activating the plant defence hormones. \n3) Induction of abiotic stress tolerance, which affects the ability of plants to absorb water.\n4) Perturbation of ripening. \n5) Enhancement of the photosynthetic capacity; Sound treatment increases expression of photosynthesis-related genes, and may induce CO2 fixation.\n֍\tDepending on previous research, Wesal shall include a mini-ultrasonicator to translate our sound messages to signals easy for plant perception, enhancing communication and improving health.\n֍\tOn the other hand, by looking at existing related products, surprisingly found very technical pots or devices that you stick into the soil close to the plant. In both cases, the products were connecting to the user's phone via an app and compiling information to create graphs, analysis and later advise on the plant's care.\n֍\tAlso found self-sustaining domestic hydroponic systems for automated plant care, with little or without human interaction.\n֍\tWesal is so different, as it depends on strengthening the interaction bond between humans and plants, as real friends.\n֍\tWesal is a planter varying in shape according to various types of plants (green plant, flowering plant, cactus or orchid), holding an encyclopedia which informs us with each plant characteristics and conditions, so we can help them according to their needs.\n֍\tWesal is provided with hidden sensors capable of measuring humidity, light, temperature and soil conditions, then comparing its compatibility with every plant type and its required conditions. Wesal translates this information into reactions by the plant language.\n֍\tWesal enhances feedback from plants in a way that remains natural and simple to comprehend; with a voice \"sounded like a plant\", organic, delicate, natural.

This design helps people to live in a healthy, comfortable beautiful mood and also helps clean the air as well as brings cheerfulness to the place. Plants and flowers make people cheerful and improve their moods, improve concentration and productivity and relieve stress. This model invokes us to think about communication between nature and civilization.\n\nWith the Pressure of the modern life and the domination of working and stereotypical life, it becomes necessary to create unique items that restore the connection with nature and ancient civilizations. Energy savings and the creation of a clean environment that is environmentally friendly and has an authentic symbol were the basis of the idea of design.\n\nThe product is originally designed to put plants inside it and preserve plant life in the indoor environment by supplying them with light. This multi-purpose product provides plants with the necessary light for photosynthesis indoors. It helps to sustain plants by providing them with light, and acts as planter light, in addition to it works as a table or desk lamp.

The Nile River is the origin of civilization and the secret of life for the Egyptians. In the Land of Egypt, it flows from Nuba and Aswan in the south to the delta and the Mediterranean Sea in the north. On its banks, the ancient Egyptian civilization grew up. So, in the Egyptian culture, the Nile is the source of life. It plays an important role in all fields and aspects of their lives and had a profound influence upon their environment. It shaped their culture and provided water, food, transportation, and excellent soil for growing food. It really preserves development and prosperity in Egypt.\n\nIn the modern era, The High Dam, which was built across the Nile in Aswan, Egypt between 1960 and 1970, is very important to the Egyptians life. It has resulted in protection from floods and droughts and increases agricultural production. One of the critical issues is generating enormous amounts of hydroelectric power in Egypt. The hydroelectric power generation relies mainly on this great dam. So, there is a uniquely strong relationship between water, electricity, and indeed life in Egypt. Water and energy are two sides of the same coin in Egypt.\n\nOn the other side, the Ankh-sometimes referred to as the key of life is a well-known symbol of eternal life in Ancient Egypt. It appears in abundance on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs and in the hieroglyphic writing and art. It was frequently depicted being held in gods' hands, representing their life-giving power in Egyptian belief. This Iconic original symbol gives a unique concept to the product.\n\nThe design structure is inspired by the map of Egypt as the Nile River is located between the eastern desert, Sinai desert, and the western desert on the other side of Egypt. Water is combined with wood, glass, and metal to create an impressive style. The Nile River waves, with their movement, were simulated in the blue twisted body in the center. The two glass vases on both sides allow plants and flowers to be arranged in them. Therefore, we also remember the map of Egypt when we see the glow head helps plants to grow like the Nile River has been helping Egypt to create its civilization. The decorative motifs in the base are inspired by the Nubian architectural style.\n\nProportion:\nThe product was designed in dimensions that fit its function as a planter light and a table lamp with harmonious proportions. We can also see the golden ratio in the design between the height of the glow head and the rest of the piece height.\n\nProperties:\nMaterials: Aluminum, Glass, Natural Wood.\nSize of product: Width 27cm x Depth 21cm x Height 52cm.",

The choice of vibrant colors is intentional to set a bold, inspirational energy to the public intriguing them into learning more about the content of the artwork ie. Egyptian culture. \n\nWith the mission to create an artwork that is not simply a painting hung on the wall but rather a full 3D experience, NL Artworks are hung away from the wall where a space in-between the wall and art emerges.

Tangible layering is reached through a scientific and artistic technique of mixing different media and materials. Each artwork is a layered piece comprised of mixed elements such as translucent prints, acrylic material and vibrant acrylic brushstrokes that revive a forgotten story. \n\nConceptual layering is achieved in the artwork on different levels: layering of time and perspectives. The monochromatic photograph is revived through a forgotten Egyptian craft: Hand-painting photography with its non original color combination, but rather with a vibrant one “bridging between an old and a new story”. Rather than taking away from the past, NL Artwork concept adds to it, promotes it, raises awareness about it and encourages the public to appreciate, learn and be inspired to continue on the rich legacy Egypt has.\n\nAnother layer is added through the play of shadows and light. With the artwork being painted on translucent material and hung away from the wall, a new space is born: The in-between, where the artwork reacts with the light source to create a third-dimensional experience to the piece.

            "a1": "We would like to take you in a journey that inspired our latest product. Grab your binoculars and lets have a look in the streets, wherever you are in the world.  \n\nMesh produce…have you ever noticed them in streets? At the juice shops, supermarkets, local grocery stores, toy shops…this net is everywhere, holding up anything at any weight. After some digging, we have found that it is one of the easiest, most economic & convenient form of packaging around the market world wide, especially for fruits and vegetables because it keeps them fresh for longer period of times. \n\nWe went back digging a bit in what is this material? In short, most of mesh produce are made of plastics, typically nylon or polypropylene. Although, it is a non-environmental material, it came to our surprise that it is even used in planting, some fishing techniques, bird haunting and maybe many other fields we have not stumbled upon yet. \n\nSince that point, all what we can think of is “what if this material is disposed in the sea?”. Not that we are disregarding street animals caught in this awful material by mistake too. But the sea, the waves, the fish, the corals was all what ran in the back of our minds.\n\nNo matter how many times we searched and researched, sketched and started modeling, we were definitely inspired by this beautiful sea life. \n\nSo, we got out our binoculars once again and had a look at this fascinating yet harsh material. This geometric genius material is expandable up to 100 times it’s size while closed, and takes the shape of whatever it holds. It is so functional, that you can even buy the reusable fabric version of it to use at the grocery, supermarkets, beach toys..etc.\n\nThe love and hate relationship we had towards this material, made us want to create a provocative object that will shed the light on the material’s consequences, and at the same time show off it’s geometric genius. \n\nWe have chosen to create a lighting unit to highlight the environmental problem that we might have been disregarding for a while. “Highlight in the light”\n\nThe SHED light is a suspended linear LED lighting fixture, that creates a water like ambient around the space it is fixed in. It is designed to fulfill some aspects you will be reading further.",
            "a2": "Product development is based on design thinking process; alternating between stages. \n\nWe started studying the mesh material, how it holds up weight and deforms, how it can reflect and diffuse light, and what can be it’s best representation material.\n\nThe Mesh: the pattern is made out of straight parallel lines connected repetitively together in certain points, creating a rhombus in the optimum stretch size. The more you stretch it, the more it turns to an irregular square. To the last stretching point, it forms a rounded rectangle with middle joints at the top and bottom. \n\nOur initial idea was to create the same mesh out of brass holding up light balls, like a net filled with 1kg of oranges. We have chosen brass to represent our heritage, and signify the Cairo’s street walk. \n\nThen came the provocative direction in one of our brainstorming sessions, to rotate the whole net and almost take out one of the bulbs as if it is falling. Thus, pushing the user to look twice, notice the object, and hopefully understand what it might be referring too. PROVOCATIVE was one of our first highlighted key word to work with. \n\nCOMPRESS & EXPAND, is the material’s behavior we are working with. We tried different applications for it; like a 2 action lighting unit; has an inside frame that can expand and contract. When it expands, the mesh turns into rounded rectangles so attached to each other thus dimming light. If the inside frame contracts, the mesh would then reach an optimum stretch size, and thus rhombuses can illuminate more light to the room. However, we couldn’t engage the sea life and evoking users in this phase. \n\nBut it turned out to be the best formula for A COMPACT SELLABLE PRODUCT, an attribute -we appreciated deeply- that came up in a later ideation session. We wanted to design a product that is taking into consideration the importance of product’s shipment process. \n\nAs many product designers, our eagerness to hold, feel and play around with this product was surfacing. We went out bought some brass rods and started our first prototype. Not for long, as it didn’t work for aesthetic reasons; the welding was showing, and wasn’t strong enough for compressing & expanding. We were successful with trying to find a substitute, a firmer aluminum rod in the jewelry market. With some jewelry tools and those rods we created our first material’s substitute mock-up. \n\nThis mock up made us realize that we need our customer to also interact with this provocative product. Maybe not all users would appreciate this feature, but surely it was an important aspect to our product ideation. “..shed the light on the material’s consequences, and at the same time show off it’s geometric genius.”\n\nUSER INTERACTION: to succeed in the user-object interaction, we had to have just the right constraints for the movement, to encourage the user to start shaping their own mesh that will suit their space.\n\nThe more we played with the mesh, the more we saw the fish’s silhouettes, scales & tails. The more we sketched, the more we had a closer eye on which designs are signifying a creature stuck or harmed, rather than the act of fishing.\n\nWe had finally reached our 4 different designs. Each has its own beauty and will signal differently to every person. We are sharing the most developed one, the SHED. \n\nSHED, is a biomimicry shaped lighting unit inspired by the plot of unconscious use of nylon mesh and the harm it causes to the environment. \n\nCustomer will receive SHED in a rectangular box (105L* 35W * 35H). The product consists of a long glass form, going through it the metal mesh, attached to it’s both ends the ceiling canopies. \n\nAs soon as the customer starts lifting it by the canopies, the mesh will begin to stretch out vertically, the glass form then will sit in it’s predesigned position, showing the material mesh expansion feature. In this stage, customers have the ability to expand and reform the mesh according to their preferences, but constraint with the glass form. Enjoy an ambient light coming from within the glass, providing a soft & even overall light to the space.",
            "q1": "Yes",
            "q2": "Improving product life cycle: In the mesh manufacturing process, we will be using metal rods, thus waste will be minimal as there is no cutting out from sheets or similar processes. The glass will be either hand made blown or press & blow, so as well no waste. SHED’s compact packing size will decrease the energy wasted in transportation; efficiently even in mass numbers, and reduce waste of broken products. Electricity energy will be efficiently used by adding LED lights-the electricity consumption of an LED light is 10 times lower, and has a 25 to 50 longer life than normal lights. Moving to disposal, it takes years for home owners, businesses or hotels to dispose a lighting units. If disposed, more than 95% of the material is biodegradable beside the wiring casing.  (as manufactured by suppliers)\n\nDesign to disassemble: products are designed to be easily disassembled, to have a chance to live a second or third life before recycled.\n\nSustainable Materials: we have managed to choose sustainable materials; glass & metal (maybe brass if we could find the right tension for expanding and contracting) that are non-toxic, easily reproduced, abundant, has low waste, biodegradable and can be recycled.",

Our product is taking into consideration the manufacturing boundaries of the metal mesh material, blown glass and electrical sources. \n\nDistribution channels: we kept in mind the increasing number of SME’s and online shopping, by creating a compact sellable material. Which will be easily & safely transported from manufacture —> seller —> courier —> buyer. \n\nExternal Producers Bond: since it has direct impact on feasibility of the product manufacturing stage. We are eager to find the right producers to understand, and can see the design goal.

            "a1": "Bamboo pharaonic wall art\nCultures’ve used bamboo for more than one purpose for centuries. You’ll find sustainable floor that is made of bamboo as wood material, island or tropical inspired furniture, rustic accessories, textile, lighting decorations and more. it’s easy to grow, harvest and transport so it is a popular choice of building material. Its properties also made it an excellent material to use. I wanted the wall accessory to be inspired from tropical style and used the Egyptian heritage so I used bamboo in different shapes and thickness , putting them layers to have 3d overlapping effect and illusion to add texture on the wall .The aesthetic unique shapes of the bamboo canes will add some nature , tropical character to the furniture and you could also use it indoors to define a space and create a tropical style that calls back to the past. this is an additional modern use of bamboo, it owes its origin to historical bamboo structures. You’ll get the benefits of modern construction with the look of the tropical rustic building material to add interest to any corner space. Ancient Egyptian civilization is one of the oldest cultures in human history and They believed that their earthly presence was only a part of their eternal journey and that death was only the beginning of a new chapter in another world. Ancient Egyptians are well-known for pioneering the fields of art . Ancient Egyptians gave us an opportunity to see thousands of beautiful texts written with images. Their unified aesthetics made it possible for complex texts to become readable and pleasant to look at. It created harmony within all of the hieroglyphs no matter who the writer was.\n\nThe Main Assets :\nin ancient Egypt eye of Horus represent protection and health.\nAccording to ancient Egyptian myth, Horus lost his left eye and the eye was magically protected by Hathor so the symbol was often used in pendants. Horus, the Egyptian Horus in ancient Egyptian religion is a god in the form of a falcon whose left eye was the moon representing healing, power and protection especially in tombs .\n\nAton, also spelled Aten, in Ancient Egyptian religion, a sun god, represented as the solar disk emitting rays ending with human hands.\n\nThe ankh is the most well-known symbol to come out of ancient Egypt it’s general meaning of the symbol in its hieroglyphic system of writing the ankh represents the concept of eternal life, The Ankh appears in Egyptian tomb paintings and art, It is known as “the key of the Nile”.\n\nAncient Egyptian symbols have affected life in ancient Egypt which was a fusion between the spiritual and the physical that showed in the form of artistic architecture, symbols and many objects that were used to bring good wealth and protection. These ancient Egyptian Symbols played an important role in passing the culture from one generation to another, as they were written on temple walls and obelisks . The Egyptian symbols were depicted in the form of hieroglyphs and used  as The Words of Gods which was used to document the most important events in ancient Egyptian History, their spiritual beliefs, and culture. \n\nThe ancient style I used :\n\nThe pure style is characterized by loyalty and attention of the nature of details and bright colors so I used main objects as eye of horus , key of life and sun god and used hieroglyphic patterns and their artistic symbols , It was widely used on the walls of public buildings. This style also incorporated painting, however it is decoratively , it didn’t lose their initial informative purpose.\n\nThe art direction :\n\nI used the flow of movement and direction, which lead the eye from one part of the composition to another in the direction from the eye of horus and Aton to the ankh then back to eye of Horus and Aton ( the son god ) . I created the flow through the combination of visual weight , depth and visual direction. Also I used repetition that works with pattern to make the work seem active and creates unity .\n\nBamboo has an unique wood texture with brownish green color paint that can add a touch of tropical style on the wall and it creates visual tone and attracts our sense of touch .\n\nEmphasized the value of the lightness and the darkness by the quantity of dashes .\n\nUse the Balance in weight by controlling the thickness and length of the bamboo pieces and the variety of the sizes of the objects .\n\nRepetition using historical hieroglyphic pattern to make the work seems active and creates unity also creates harmony between all parts of the artwork .",
            "a2": "The reason why I used bamboo\nIt has shallow roots so it would be easy to cut in different sizes and thickness to achieve the shadows and lights in the design\neco-friendly and durable to the environment. Bamboo products have become popular in recent years as people are becoming more and more eco-friendly and want to support eco-friendly homes also we used eco friendly transparent adhesive , jute background (kheish) and green ecofriendly paint .\n\nits antibacterial and Its strength, This means you do not have to use any chemicals on your bamboo interior piece, it will remove any bacteria found on its surface by itself.\n\nIts flexibility: Bamboo bends without breaking. Bamboo bends with external force instead of breaking and can return to its original shape. Its flexibility also makes bamboo useful for curved parts.\n\nInnovation of local material . it is a combination of providing high quality interior designs and still being able to support the local communities where the bamboo furniture is made.\n\nIt lasts for years and it is water resistant as it lasts much longer than wood\n\nEarly uses: Over 5,000 years ago, Chinese people used bamboo to build tree houses . From around 200 BCE to 200 CE , bamboo used in manufacture of paper and books. The more properties discovered about this plant, the more they wanted to use it.\n\nDeveloping applications: Bamboo came inside for use as an interior building material in the 1300s.people used the plant to create bedding and flooring for their homes. bamboo has become as a building material for indoor and outdoor use alike.\n\nMore than furniture: Beginning in the 600s, people used bamboo to make musical instruments. Other cultural uses of bamboo include art inspiration, poetry and music.\n\nBamboo becomes hardwood: In the late 1990s, architects in China developed ways that made bamboo look and feel like hardwood by cutting the bamboo and interlocking it. Curing bamboo can be fun procedure doing it in home. In the beginning drying it is an essential step that will enable us to have an effective output in the end. Also, looking for longer and straighter appearance of the culms is sturdier. Before curing it, we have to remove the infected culms as it can spread. Once these steps are done, we can begin to use the simplest way by grill to cure the bamboo while using a protective glove to avoid getting burned. After that we can maintain its green color by using green eco friendly paint to color it with its green color .\n\nUsed raw local material in creating art:\n\nUsing materials from local or regional sources is considered to be a very good choice for many green designers. Using locally available resources for art help in the protection of environment.\nEvery material delivers something special in the creative progression. the art created from material previously deemed unusable, unwanted, or broken such as bamboo small sticks that used to make shadows and lights and movement is a form of sustainable art that has the potential to have a great attention in the coming years as bamboo combines between lightness, strength, and flexibility with natural beauty . local products materials are often required because they match the aesthetic local designs and can be more durable in the local climate. Also, to build a sense of belonging , an emotional relationship between people and places, use of local materials and products is spirited. This degree of enthusiasm makes people more relaxed at work and has an effect on the well-being of humans. Architects, designers and builders need to confront the troublesome errand of assembly the requirements for modern buildings and structures that are reasonable, secure, sound and beneficial whereas minimizing any negative results for society, the environment and the economy. Beneath the best circumstances, building structures ought to lead to positive comes about in all three areas. The viewer should make sure that the viewer takes a positive message from their art. Now more than ever we stand in need of such messages. Due to the environmental high impact of modern human civilization, the world stands in need of sustainability. artists from all around the world should raise their messages through sustainable art. the technologies and interior designs have been facing \nchallenges due to unsustainable aspects of some building materials. This has put stress on the environment and has also increased use of energy and other degradable resources. On the hindsight, this has also created opportunities for innovative and unconventional resources to emerge by reinventing the traditional building materials and \nusing it in an intelligent way also local products materials are often required because they match the aesthetic local designs and can be more durable in the local climate.",

Where urbanization elevated the demand for housing, deforestation causing high carbon levels to rise significantly. We aim to raise awareness for the Egyptian people to use raw, local materials in their lifestyle even in decorative pieces. From manufacturers perspective the adoption of bamboo material used will expand their scale of operations. Unusually, for bamboo material to be used in a piece of art. So, we made it our purpose to use it and add value for it. The power of bamboo material is sustained from centuries so adding this innovation part we see it will reduce the usage of not eco-friendly material in decorative pieces for instance as plastic colors, and Gibson boards, etc…  \n\nChoosing PVA glue which is water based and it is colorless where is won’t appear as an excess during adherence. Also, it’s not toxic safely used for children and individuals. Additionally, it’s a very strong than any other sustained material and it can join wood together. Further, considering jute “kheish” because it is safe instead of using glass and it is used with the prevailing perspective of eco-friendly materials that operators aims to use more often than any other . Also I chose to use green eco friendly paint to varnish the bamboo and to give a glow to the bamboo colors because I don’t want the brown color of bamboo to be shown hundred precent .",

So, our mission was to innovate idea that will take advantage of this eco-friendly material that is safe, and strong. Additionally, the workers were not aware of the power of bamboo so this will add value and specializations besides the manufacturers have a massive profit from this. Moreover, bamboo contributed in making new work process as follows the farmers will cultivate, smoothing the clumps and deliver it the designers that will transform it to a special piece of art that will be the first to be used with bamboo material. Lastly, the hand-made workers “crafts” they have role of execution which is cutting bamboo into pieces with different thickness and use the executed design. Yet this was a mix between the pharaonic heritage and the bamboo manufacturing in the interior design. Which had brought the sensation of island style inspiration that can fit the Egyptian and non- Egyptian homes. Lastly, we aimed to use the art direction for instance as an eye movement and balance inside the design in a wall art. Thus, the pharaonic heritage was used with a touch of modern art.",

            "q8": "The role of bamboo in employment generation :\nThe evolution has increased the productivity of bamboo turning it into water preservation, maintenance of health because it sustains the oxygen level in the atmosphere so it reduces emissions. Additionally, the bamboo contributes in employment of a low skilled labor force specifically from rural regions in Egypt. Therefore, higher labor participation rates in Egypt. Besides the worker characteristics is that they work with handmade crafts with artistic point of views. Thus, more products used with bamboo. The process of bamboo consists of several steps cleaning the bamboo sticks, cutting the twisted branches and smoothening the branch are all prepared manually with a hook which is a primitive tool that is used by the farmers. \n\nFurther, in order to facilitate the steps for the purchaser, transportation and exhibition so we inserted the design in jute “kheish”. This will give the heritage sensation plus the eco-friendly material, this will lessen the effort for the purchaser from the hustle of arranging pieces on wall. Also, considering the Egyptian transparent glue for sustainable and it’s a strong glue that can stick the jute “khiesh” with bamboo.\n\nSo, this will produce a new handmade job that specialized in cutting and forming bamboo with different thickness and layers using this power in transformation through out art pieces.",

By using these kinds of materials, no toxic chemicals are needed to produce a viable product. That means that when you decide that you don’t need it anymore, the product can be dipped into your garden and left to naturally decay. \n\nI see it as the ultimate solution for “getting rid of things”. Instead of “storing” them or having the earth “store” them for years and years, these materials will decay naturally, offering an alternative to standard plastics, which as we know, never decay!\n\nThe objects and materials I have developed also have another aim…\nThey aspire to start a conversation, educate and enlighten us on how they’ve been made and whom they’ve been made by. By using unexpected ingredients and experimenting with different methods of making, I hope that these materials make us enquire more about the ingredients in our products. I want people to question why certain ingredients are used. I want to inspire curiosity and a desire to choose healthier alternatives.",

Eggshell is a strong bio-filler candidate since it contains high percentages of CaCO3, which exists in bulk quantity and is inexpensive. \n\nMoreover, the integral components of eggshell enables the reduction of shrinkage during molding, enhances stiffness and flammability resistance of the biopolymers used.\nThe idea behind Shell Homage is to work with biopolymers and natural fillers, experiment with the unexpected influences of these materials, and explore different ways of producing materials, from high-tech processing techniques to the handmade.",

            "q8": "We need to work with nature rather than against it, learning from nature’s best methods for furthering production not just of materials but of end products. To reach this point, we need to overcome certain presumptions about what our products should look like. We need to pull together some newer production methods, and materials that show promising substitutions. Materials that make us rethink how we make things and what those things could be made of.\n\nIn our profession, it’s very important to work on material research projects. While material science demonstrates the importance of understanding material from all perspectives, it only provides us with only a part of the puzzle. In the end, I think designers should initiate more collaboration. It is their responsibility to speak both languages. Creativity comes from trials and explorations drawn from other fields.  It’s all about having a curiosity to experiment with new things and not to limit yourself to the knowledge you have gained from your field. It is not an easy task to bridge the gap in information and technique. What matters is the process of finding solutions that are meaningful to people, and that enable new ways of understanding, inspiring, and creating a positive impact in society and in our own daily lives. I also think that we shouldn’t focus only on objects and installations but also on the creative process of how something is made.\n\nShell Homage was initiated during my master’s research project, where I was inspired by the aim to reinterpret each material group and communicate their qualities as well as the environmental problems they speak to. I wanted to then, and still do now: create products that have a life span and are able to be returned back to nature when that life span is up. \n\nShell Homage studio offers designed products that are not only intended to provide a basic function, but also an experience that is meaningful and delightful to the user. I want to stir emotional and intellectual curiosities within consumers. I propose a new way to look at “shells”, and in doing so I hope to reveal this material’s personal homage. \nI hope my work will inspire others to do something out of food waste as well. There is so much to do in the world of food, since it’s one of the biggest industries on earth! I think a lot of creativity is needed to address those things. A designer can be the activist and the cause for change. He or she must be innovative in spirit, seeking out collaborators to reach amazing solutions which outperform and offer truly viable alternatives to current approaches. The pursuit is to be in full control of the lifespan of the product, from its origin – in the form of natural material – through to the final product until its inescapable decay.",

            "a2": "Reblox was designed due to the (anthropometry) science to make sure that the applications built by Reblox have met the human body ratios and universal design standards.\n\nFurthermore, to ease the building process, the block was designed to be connected without bonding materials, it is designed with studs and inner ribs to interlock with each other with no need to bonding material, as is customary in traditional red bricks; this saves a lot of time, effort and facilitates the building process\n\nReblox was manufactured out of recyclable and recycled plastic polymers which gave the block a shiny appearance and presence. Surfaces were designed plain and smooth with slightly rounded edges. The appearance is accentuated with solid and transparent colors to accommodate all styles and spatial designs. The plain surfaces allow the user to use adhesive materials like stickers or wallpapers to change the design or style whenever needed. Moreover, Reblox designed the block with an open rooftop and side gates to facilitate any electrical installations.  \n\n The block has many specs and they are as follows:\n1. Sustainability.\nThe block is made out of recycled and recyclable plastic which can save tones of plastic that could have been thrown into oceans and seas. \n\n2. Endurance.\nThe brick is robust enough and heavy duty to last for long, while being flexible enough to be transformed or redesigned continuously.\n\n3. Thermal Resistance.\nReblox has a better thermal resistance factor compared to conventional materials in the market which can save up to 50% of the electricity used for air-conditioning due to its low thermal transmittance value.\n\n4. UV Resistant.\n Reblox resists the ultraviolet rays in the outdoor use which preserves the brick to last for long. \n\n5. Water Resistant.\nPlastic is not a porous material; therefore, it doesn’t absorb water and doesn’t cause any damage when being exposed to humidity.\n\n6. Fire Resistant.\nReblox has developed a grade resistant to fire. This grade doesn’t make ignition by exposing to fire. The grade was tested and certified due to UL94_V0 standard. \n\n7. Strength. \nDue to the compression test, Reblox can bear weight up to 10 kg/cm2. \n\n8. Weight.\nReblox is quite light; it is 10.5 kg/m2 compared to 100kg/m2 in red bricks.",

            "q2": "1.\tEnvironmentally: \nEgypt produces around 970,000 tons of plastic waste annually. “El Gundy Z., Ahram online, Egypt in the process of going plastic-free: The little thing that make a big difference, Sep.23, 2019”.  Since Reblox is made out of recycling and recyclable plastic, it will reduce the waste by turning it into useful product. Besides, it emits zero Co2 during production which reduces the greenhouse gas. \n\nResidential, industrial, administrative and commercial sectors in Egypt consume 79% from the total energy produced. “http://www.moee.gov.eg/test_new/PDFReports/2018-2019AR.pdf p.84”.\nDue to some articles, air conditioners consume around 65% from total electricity. Accordingly, there is a need for thermal resistant walls to reduce the energy consumption for cooling.\n\nReblox walls save up to 15% from the energy consumption for cooling due to the cavity inside the block which works as thermal resistant. Furthermore, Reblox has developed a thermal resistant grade which is filled with foam to reduce the wall thermal transmittance factor (U-value: 0.2w/m2k). It saves around 50% from the energy consumption in cooling compared to red brick walls.\n\nEventually, we can reduce desertification by using Reblox blocks and diminishing the use of the red bricks.\n\n2. Socially: \nA. User friendly: People can install and dismantle this product by themselves (DIY). And due to its flexibility, they can use the same blocks continuously to design completely different applications which saves time and money. In addition to that, users can resale their blocks when they don’t need it.\n\n3. Economically:\nReblox is supporting the circular economy in Egypt by two methods:\nA.\tUsing recycled and recyclable plastic.\nB.\tCreating a trade-in service to recycle unused blocks.\n\nFurthermore, and on a national level:\nC.\tReducing the imported materials, hence saving expenditure cost and foreign currency.\nD.\tCreating job opportunities for people in Egypt.",

Moreover, \nthe blocks interlock with each other with no bonding materials which eases the building process.\n\nEconomically, Reblox saves money by turning the applications to complete new different ones using the same blocks of the previous application. \n\nOpen studs: Since building walls is a main application, the block was designed with an open studs and side gates to let electrical conduits pass vertically and horizontally. Furthermore, when we install walls, the open studs connect the cavity inside each block with the other ones which increases the air volume inside the wall and makes it one connected volume,  thus reducing the heat transmission because the heat takes times to warm up the whole area of air before being transferred to the other side. By delaying the heat transfer, we reduce the electricity consumed for cooling.\n\nIn addition to that, Reblox has the following specs:\n1. Thermal Resistant grade: Saves up to 50% from the energy consumption in cooling (U-value: 0.2 w/m2k) compared to red bricks. “Energy simulation modeling, Design Builder program”\n2. UV Resistant grade: For outdoor use.\n3. Fire Resistant grade: No ignition when it exposed to fire and it meets \nUL94_V0 standard. “Test held by the Egyptian Plastic Technology Center”\n4. Water Resistance: Almost zero% absorption.\n5. Compression: bears 10kg/cm2. “Held in German University in Cairo labs”\n6. Weight: 10.5 kg/m2 Vs. 100kg/m2 in red bricks.\n7. Endurance: Heavy duty.\n8.

No one designed this block with open studs before, however, it solves technical issues and enhances the thermal performance of the block.\n\n3. Inside ribs: the inside ribs let the blocks interlock with each other with no need for bonding material; this makes it easy and simple to use (user friendly).\n\n4.  Ready-made sets _ DIY: To help all people install the applications themselves, we have created (ready-made kits). Those kits are provided with exact number of blocks required for the application + supplementary accessories + assembly manual to guide the users how to install the application. \n\n5. Compatibility with other materials: Reblox is trying to be compatible with all other materials possible to provide complete solutions for customers. Hence, Reblox always has its own unique and creative way of how to connect and link Reblox with other materials together which eventually creates what so called Reblox system.   \n\n6. Reblox community: Reblox will create a community that will be thinking Reblox, who will furnish all their spaces with Reblox, who generate new applications and designs and exchange their blocks with each other; they will meet both online and possibly physically to exchange ideas, talk about designs, build models and creatively enjoy their time",

            "a1": "This design was inspired by our great balance of the ancient construction and carpentry of the muqarnas, arches, and eastern domes that appear in mosques and various buildings, with a combination of them with the industrial design line using rebar to give durability and sustainability to the design.\n\n The design was enhanced to be more balanced with velor fabrics in the royal green color used frequently in the art of the (Minator) and his old paintings. To complete the meaning, an elongated pillow was added that twins the shape of the sofa with a golden fabric embroidered with some (motifs) inspired by Behzad’s work and repeated in the golden miniature paintings that bear a legendary character  My stories have been used to revive it again and to soften the industrial constructivist impression of the sofa. I note here that this pillow has a special series that I designed with close knowledge in the world of miniature and gilding.\n\n In this design, I deliberately combined comfort, luxury, durability and modernity at the same time. With the trend of the majority of international designs towards comfort, practicality, clear lines and reducing details in the designs, there has become some repetition, so the uniqueness of the consumer with a distinct piece of furniture depends on the quality of manufacturing and the brand only, not on the aesthetic and difference.\n\n Unlike what happened in the last century.  Each piece has its own character and aesthetic feature, even if it is cheap and simple. For example, the guard’s seat in front of the building was a masterpiece that we acquire today to make a distinct and elegant corner, as well as the door of an old apartment in a neighborhood that did not enter services, but it carries within the folds the quality of the craft and the uniqueness of the decorations.  All the details of the furniture were not carved in vain, but rather to live for decades, bearing the imprint of the place and the identity of its people between its sides.\n\n In this design, I wanted to use the spirit of contemporary art in suggesting a meaning and a questionable thought by carving arches on natural wood that gives the design life and sustainability.  It is preferred to use manual sculpting with modernization of the style in order to employ the heritage and historical inheritance of aesthetics in furniture and fabrics. Some of the crafts that were unique to the East for a long time almost disappeared, such as muqarnas, domes, and manual sculpting in general, which needs someone to bring it back to life, secondly, through a modern recruitment that suits the modern vision and the difference  Lifestyle and living spaces, as the dimension of the contemporary trend in furniture design from the visual crowd and the tendency to (minimalist) does not mean that the spaces are devoid of aesthetic details, but rather it is more appropriate to employ them by reducing the quantity and accumulation that was previously used in furniture\n\n Innovation\n\n The design is an innovative approach to restore the cultural and aesthetic heritage to modern life with simple touches, with the help of the high capacity of the carving craft that characterizes the entire Damietta Governorate in Egypt, and also taking advantage of local embroidery, which is characterized by simple, fast lines with the renewal of its traditional style and adding new symbols to it.  The innovative trend in design brings up building arches with a modern sofa or the overlap of arabesques with (postmodern) or japandi furniture (or the symbols of Iranian carpets in their colors within the Scandinavian style (skandi).\n\n Sustainability\n\n The use of natural tree trunks without wasting.  For the beauty of its external appearance, it does not need to be finished except for some natural oils that show the beauty of wood inlays, which are environmentally friendly materials that give sustainability to the piece with the reuse of used rebar, which depends in its manufacture on recycling, by changing its function as a building squeezing and reconfiguring it to hold the base of the sofa, which gives the product durability  With a shortage of workers manufacturing the product",
            "a2": "Executive part\n\n The basic construction of the design is four legs of steel reinforcement with a wide iron support along the length of the sofa, carried on a wooden base and boxes for the two armrests.\n\n Hand carving on wood has been favored to carve (arches) on both sides, with a gradation in the details of the carving.  The edges of the wood are deliberately vandalized in order to show the beauty of the wood and give the effect of the old construction, taking into account the thickness of the wood in vandalism and drilling. A large part of the vandalism comes on the side supported by the base of the sofa, which is wood with a height that allows to show the accuracy of the carving.\n\n As for the types of wood used in the base, it is beech or walnut, taking into account the choice of the piece of wood used and the extent of its dryness with the diameter of the rebar and the bearing capacity in order to reach the best endurance and sustainability of the piece\n\n Using steel reinforcement in the four legs with an angled angle aims to make the base of the sofa more comfortable.  It is welded with an iron support along the wooden base.  The design follows the direction of industrial design featured with the coldness of metals that suit the progress of machines and industries, including an unconventional aesthetic concept that suggests making the impossible possible.\n\n As for the fabrics and upholstery in this design, the harmony of the lines with each other was taken into consideration. A high density foam was added to the design. The shape of the sponge was manipulated and stitched to harmonize the shape of the larch in line with (fluted finishes trend) as well as the armrests\n\n Product development from the profit and implementation side: What the design aims at is a balance between the use of the aesthetics of heritage and modernity, which has become possible with the adaptation of current technology to different materials. So, engineered wood, which is less expensive and much lighter, can now be used for carving, and it is possible to cut stainless steel into attractive shapes that consumers can afford. Several designs can emerge from this one, such as arches carved in nested tables with used iron or stainless steel to become a profitable product that is easy to present to the consumer\n\n One of the negative observations in the period when everyone was forced to stay at home due to the global Corona pandemic is that we all felt the need for a change inside the house in an attempt to find a comfortable aesthetic perspective within the space in which we live, This was for the purpose of recreation or as a matter of humor during our conversations via Zoom in which we felt the need for some aesthetics in the background, it is preferable that we first beautify the permanent backgrounds in our real life through innovation as well as through integrating modern concepts, such as by using modern curtains that reflect the beauty of the sun inspired by the old Arabesque windows, or seashells in interlocking tables, or adding a realistic effect to our image via a filter that has also images of a fanciful miniature with gilded sides.",

All by the help of adjustable seat heights and depths and lumbar support that gives ample support for the lower back so that your spine is in just the correct position to provide good posture. For further information the word ergonomic itself refers to improved chair support, and not a type of chair.\nOur inspiration?\nThe human body muscles and the statement interior space chair. \nWe want to combine the human body comfort and correct support of an ergonomic office chair in a luxurious way. Also putting into consideration the pressure points in a human body to add to the ordinary ergonomics of an office chair.\nHave you ever seen a lumbar support chair that is put as a luxury statement in a living room?\nOur fluka chair is a multi-function and multi-use chair that allows you to experience the full seating experience without any boredom or discomfort on a long term. Its as if you’re floating on a flying chair, which is exactly our aim.\nMultiple layers?\nWe were trying to come up with solutions to fix problems that people face every day in the office environment as it’s the only environment that people experience the discomfort and lack of support of chairs. Statistically people sit over 10 hours a day in their chairs at offices. Along with that we were also considering and trying to reach a luxurious statement chair form in a living space, so that the person can also benefit from a work at home friendly supportive chair that can give you the full office chair support experience. We looked at all kinds of chairs ball chairs and stools and we notice how unstable those are above this they didn't really fit into the office environment. The standard office chair and ordinary chairs really fight against what our bodies are naturally supposed to do we're built to move or kinetic! we're supposed to release energy! People sit in different ways all day long, therefore we designed this chair to help support your natural tendency to sit in different positions having a seat pan that is disconnected from the main body, which is very energetic, and energy and muscle freedom is what we wanted to capture on the design. So, once you sit on the chair it will move with you kinetically, instantly giving you the feel of its airy kinetics. \nThe chair gives the user a feeling of connection between the user’s body and the chair. The design allows the user’s body and the chair to feel like one",

It helps to minimize heat transfer between the two outermost layers. If this layer isn’t present, the ambient temperature of the gel could cause heat loss from the body and feel cold while sitting. The thermal insulator isn’t the most glamorous part of the cooling, but it is an important one.\n\n3-Memory foam: \nHistory: First designed in the 1960’s for use in NASA spaceship seats and seatbelts, shock-absorbing, pressure-relieving memory foam has also been used as cushioning in helmets and shoes, and use in prosthetics and wheelchair seating pads.\nWhat is Memory Foam Made Of?\nBy the addition of many chemical compounds and additives to the polyurethane with a degree of polyether polyol , two of the main qualities of memory foam are affected: viscosity and elasticity.\n “viscous”, we mean that it takes a long time to change shape under pressure, or to transfer energy from one place to another. \n “elastic”, it means it can stretch or contort but return to its original shape or size when the stretching force is taken away,\nHow Does Memory Foam Work?\nAs we outlined above, memory foam is designed to slowly mold to the body in response to pressure, and as a result evenly distribute body weight and help the chair cushion the body evenly, creating the slow contouring feeling as the chair reforms around your curves. They are also designed to be resilient, and to return to their original shape once body weight and pressure is removed on an average of around 5-10 seconds. Over this period of time energy is absorbed and dissipated, which is a phenomenon known as “Hysteresis” that removes some of the pressure produced by the prone body.\n\nIf you apply pressure quickly, the foam tends to change shape more slowly, or “reluctantly.” \nThis means that memory foam is excellent at absorbing the force of an impact.\n\nMEMORY FOAM VISCOSITY IS INVERSLY PROPORTIONAL TO TEMPERATURE!\nAn important part of how our memory foam works is that its viscosity decreases as temperature increases. This means that it becomes less stiff and more flexible the hotter it gets, making it lose the character of returning back to its original form. WE CAME TO A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. \nBy the use of the cooling gel laminated layer the gel can balance the temperature and prevent it to heat up , which protects the memory form from deforming and giving the chair a longer life span. This makes the user feel cooled and comfortable throughout the whole seating experience.\n\n4-Final exterior Crepe layer: Crepe is a sustainable cotton-based textile that is a product of cellulose. The material is locally produced with best quality as Egypt is known for best cotton production in the world. The material has a comfortable and breathable feel that allows the cooling mechanism to work at its finest. The material also provides a silky finish to it giving it a luxurious feel to it.",

That’s why I decided to bring them to life in a way that copes with the present.\nA legendary touch from the past blends with the new art creating this exceptional piece that tells a-lot.\n\n639 CE until the brief end of the 16th century marked the great Islamic era which was led by Amr Ibn el As on Egypt. \nThis era was a great transformation in the Egyptian history and it lies between the two alternative dynasties that together formed the great and magnificent Egyptian history. This era was one in which Egypt cast off the heritage of the past to embrace a new culture in which Egyptian Islamic civilization evolved. During that period Egypt was part of a great world empire. \n\nMy product is a one that glorifies and praises the great Islamic era. Perpetuating the memory of such a great Egyptian history transformation while adding the modern twist of the new Egypt we live in now to suit our daily lives.",
            "a2": "It all started with a college trip to omar ebn el as mosque, I kept staring at the dome and the inner lighting units for hours. I went home and started to research about the islamic empire, how they dressed, the colors they use, the patterns and the products they created for living.\n\nAfter tons of researches and sleepless nights my gallery was filled with astonishing mosques, architectures, kilim carpets, outfits of rulers and loads of potteries. With one common element which was fine smooth curves with hints of blue, it took me few seconds to research why blue? Then I realised that books were created explaining the reason behind it. It was proven that blue is the sign of cleanness and spirituality back then. In the architecture of Islamic mosques the colors blue and turquois blue are used abundantly. The traditional people believed in the holiness of turquoise blue. They integrated blue within almost each and every piece. \n\nWhile brainstorming my product that will speak out this story I decided to add a hint of turquoise blue making it  one of my primary colors in my color palette. And because Water is what makes us humans, water bottle was my inspiration to create my story.\n\nGlass is aesthetically appealing material made out of sand, hygiene substance created out of raw material, reusable and recyclable well know with it’s transparency, dust resistance and color availability. \nIt is the best match for water and to be placed in interiors including homes. \n\n60% of the human body is water, water defines us, it creates the body shape. the soothing water waves that is created when the water is poured in a flask or a cup is another feature that I wanted to add in my design. the perfect curved waves that are created resemble the human body’s curves and spirality, these when added to my design create a remarkable perspective. and that’s together with the nude effect and water blue are elements that I wanted to integrate in my product. \nAfter gathering enough knowledge to start, I decided to design a water bottle out of glass. While adding inspirations from the islamic art as the cap that was inspired from the sultans hats during this era in addition to hint of turquoise blue to compliment the water effect. Also it’s shape is inspired from the water potteries and it has curves that remains people of the human body creation.\n\nIt took two weeks of hard work and insistence along with excitement to define the final shape, I started by adding a tracing papers into my sketchbook and started to recreate the lines till I felt this shape was the most suitable one. After that I created a mood board using the colors I previously mentioned and the vibes I wanted to deliver. Then I took my design and started to 3D model my product into ratio of 1:1 in rhino 3D and renders in keyshot. After that I started with the production phase then the photoshoot of my final product.",

A method called the glassblowing was used specifically during the islamic era integrated with paint. Glassblowing is a glassforming technique that involves inflating molten glass into a bubble with the aid of a blowpipe.\n\nI searched for a place where glassblowers work in and I was amazed that gamaleya street have a lot of workshops and that glassblowing is actually an Egyptian famous craft that was about to vanish. Knowing that made me insist more to make my design a handcrafted one. I went to gamaleya street and I met with one of the glassblowers, I showed him the design I have created and surprisingly he implemented it without any flaws. It was a piece of art. I was astonished. The way he takes control of the glass and shapes it before the glass cools under a curtain temperature is an innovation that I would like it to keep living on. I beileve that it’s time to bring the handcrafts and methods that come from the past and blend them with our present to create the wonders of an era of an ongoing life.",

            "a1": "We believe that drawing inspiration from heritage, and presenting it in modern lines, turns furniture into distinctive pieces that integrate ancient civilizations with our modern times. This allows furniture owners to widen their artistic horizons and feel connected to their roots, all while being present in their current reality. We believe that every designer has a passion that shows their mark in any of their work. Our mark is demonstrated in the modern way of reviving the Arab heritage and presenting it in a manner that highlights originality, quality of details and simplification, as our designs reach loving homes in the best image.\n\nOur choice to use \"Iwan Kisra\" as the main inspiration was motivated by our desire to create modern designs with the essence of identity. The past couple of years witnessed a shift in consumer taste in the field of interior design and home furniture. Designs inspired by the Art Deco movement became trendy again and furniture owners expressed their desire in owning furniture pieces that contain Art Deco elements, such as geometric shapes, arches, and mixed materials.\n\nWe believe that Middle Eastern Arts and Architecture is a rich tapestry for inspiration. It contains design elements that inspired various movements that followed. Our motivation for designing \"Kisra\" was to find the original source for Art Deco design elements within Middle Eastern Art and Architecture. The façade composition of Iwan Kisra contains different sequences of rounded arches that proliferate the Art Deco movement. Furthermore, our research showed that Sasanians heavily relied on brass for their art and coins. Mixing different materials like wood and brass is one of the major elements of the Art deco aesthetic. By simply considering these different elements of Sasanian arts and architecture, we were able to develop a TV unit that is rich in identity and maintains a trendy, art deco look.\n\nThe Kisra TV unit exemplifies Maqam's values in highlighting Middle Eastern heritage and reviving local crafts in a contemporary fashion. The design is inspired by the historic architecture of one of the most mesmerizing landmarks in Iraq, “Iwan Kisra”. The television unit includes a shelving cabinet in the form of intersecting arches. The distributions of these arches, as well as dimensions reflect the design of Iwan Kisra's façade. The final design is a result of an extensive research and analysis process, which will be further discussed in the next statement.",
            "a2": "We believe that each time period has a different source of inspiration that has its own characteristics. Each of these eras include sources of strength and impact. By identifying a specific land mark for inspiration, we initiate a design process that takes into account each element of the era in which the landmark stood. This includes form, cultural context, arts, and materials. Furthermore, our design process includes analyzing spaces, destinations, or any geometric unit in a historic building.\n\nAs the Art Deco styles continue to rise in popularity, we wanted to create a trendy TV unit that has deeper cultural values. Art Deco is characterized by the abundance of shapes and the blended use of different materials such as wood and brass. The shapes of Art Deco are available in many historical designs, including Middle Eastern architecture. \n\nWe selected Iwan Kisra as our main inspiration for this project due to its historic and cultural significance. Its design follows the Sasanian Architectural style and contains the largest single-span vault of unreinforced brickwork in the world. The building was also mentioned in the famous poem of Al-Buhtury, in which he describes the beauty of Iwan Kisra and how it withstands the forces of time. Another reason for choosing Iwan Kisra for inspiration, was the repetitive use of rounded arches. Round arches are one of the main elements of Art Deco designs, which recently came back in trend.it\n\nFor the Kisra TV unit, we were inspired by the mesmerizing façade of Iwan Kisra. We analyzed different design elements of the architecture of the building, including the dimensions and sequencing of the arches for each floor. With each additional floor, one arch is added and the overall size of each arch shrinks by a certain ratio. For instance, the size of each arch in the first floor is half the size of the ones in the ground floor. While the size of the third floor arches is third the size of the ones in the ground floor (see façade design analysis in the photo submission).\n\nUsing the above ratios and sequencing, we created a basic motif of five arches, where smaller arches subset larger ones. We then created different iterations of this motif until we reached the final form for the Kisra television unit (See sketching of design iterations in the photo submission). The iterations followed basic guidelines of Sasanian Architecture, including repetition, centrality and descending sizes.\n\nIn addition to analyzing the architectural elements of Sasanian Architecture, we also researched the different elements of arts during that period. We identified brass as one the main materials used at the time and added it to Kisra's design in a contemporary way. This further reinforced the rich design mix of Kesra, as it connects two different styles, namely Sasanian and Art Deco.",

The module is a certain closed-form that can be used as a table by placing a glass panel or an alternative to the glass, and then by pulling one side of that shape, the shape is separated in half, the table becomes an open and closed chair and the table can be adjusted to its height. I've modified the design more than once to make sure that it can be implemented and make sure that there are some design requirements, such as ease of use and user experience, as well as not taking into account the kinetic aspects of dimensions and other factors, as well as trying to make the product usable in many places.",

Space saving furniture is usually more innovative , modern in style and designed to accommodates smaller living areas.\nThe first functionality of the piece is providing a proper storage for the art suppliers , which any art student or any designers uses in his daily life that causes the place to be messy as the markers , pencil colors , pens and so many other staff that we designers uses.\n Also a place for the rolled long papers , which the art students and designers uses in abundance , and don't how to store them properly so they will not be harmed because of the poor storage .\nIt also provide another type of drawers for the storage of sketch books, note books  a box of pastel colors..etc, and the piece is not only for storage but also it can use as a study desk , and it's dimensions fits the huge papers that the students and the designers uses in the big projects, so it can be used as an engineering table , so it's a multifunctional piece that solves all the problems that anyone in the art field faces when it comes to designing.\nThe style used is \"DE Stijl \" style ,it’s Dutch for ‘the style’ and the name of a radical minimalist art movement founded in The Netherlands in 1917. Co-founder Piet Mondrian was probably its most famous member. Much of our modern love of open-plan living and geometric furniture comes straight out of the experiments of De Stijl. \nIt was highly influential in furniture design, architecture, painting, sculpture and even literature – which is as well, because they advocated close collaboration between all art forms – and it inspired many well-known 20th century designers, including Miles van der Rohe.\nAnd the statement \"ART SEVES ART\" means that the concept used in the colors and lines of the design which inspired from \"DE STIJL \" which an \"art\" movement , which serves the piece of furniture that made for an 'art' purpose . \nso to sum up we can say that the design aims are :\n-Designing a space saving office to integrate with nowadays space living.\n-Organizing most of the art and office suppliers in one piece.\nTarget audience: Artists / art students / engineering students / and any one in the engineering field",

People keep plants in their homes not only for aesthetic reasons but also because they evoke positive feelings and a happier state of mind.\n֍\tUnfortunately, some of us still have trouble taking care of plants; simply because they can’t talk our language to tell us their needs, which seems like it requires a sort of special sense or knowledge to understand their needs just by looking at them. Does she need more water or was the water too much? Was there no sunlight? Is her type requires indoor or outdoor caring conditions? Is a bigger suitable pot needed as she grows up? Are there any chewing insects or invading enemies? Does she suffer from pain or stress? Why did she not survive? These are all questions that many of us have had at one point in time or another and this is precisely what “Wesal” is trying to solve.\n֍\tWesal introduces the unique personality of each plant, representing plants with real funny characters.\n֍\tWesal creates a conversational mode, giving the chance to this seemingly mundane creature to express her feelings, to ask for attention if you have not paid attention to it for a while, and to react when spoken to with a cute face and expressive voice.\n֍\tWesal surrounds each personified plant with her perfect environment, providing her with all essential and supplementary conditions for healthy growing; from watering, minerals, lighting, pH levels and temperature, to surrounding her with entertaining and calming music.\n֍\tWesal aims to prove that plant is the best friend for us from kids to elders, lonely or social, busy or free-scheduled, lacking a green thumb or gardening professionals.\n֍\tWesal aims also to enhance people behaviour with morals as the plant rises in front of them; such as Mercy, Beauty of caring, giving unconditionally, sustaining our green ecosystem with gratitude for precious gifts: water, Sun, and Mother Earth.",
            "a2": "My product began with an imaginative idea as I was talking to my recuperating plant, then wondering: Oh! Did she hear me? Oh! Did she reply to my words? Oh! Did she feel my sadness when she was sick?; Yes, I’m sure she does. But how can I prove it?\n֍\tSo I began to research and found several studies showing that researchers have been able to document plant sounds using sensors and electrodes. They have found different responses when they are in pain or thirsty.\n֍\tSome biological studies indicate that plants are highly sensitive organisms that generate and react to sound signals from their environment.\n֍\tExperiments found that specific frequencies of bee buzzing facilitate the pollination of flowers. In addition, recorded insect chewing sounds induce the production of chemicals related to plant defence. So, plants respond to insects through sound, either serving as warning signals or beneficial signals to the plant.\n֍\tHowever, the specific organs or proteins used for sound perception have not yet been identified, cutting-edge technology now believes that plants can indeed benefit from sound through their mechanosensory machinery. \n֍\tRecent studies using ‘omics’ technologies, such as transcriptome and proteomic analyses, showed that proper sound treatment has a positive effect on plant growth, as they exhibit transcriptional and hormonal changes in response to sound wave treatment.\n֍\tPlant hormones typically regulate plant cellular processes and orchestrate most aspects of plant physiology including plant growth, flowering, ripening, senescence, and defence responses, sound-induced hormonal changes might increase plant growth and provide strong resistance against biotic or abiotic stress. \n֍\tResearch by South Korea’s National Institute of Agricultural Biotechnology shows that: plants begin to react to sound at 70 decibels. Lucky for us, 70 decibels is the sound level for the average human conversation. Speaking, playing music and natural sound waves and vibrations provided from the environment all play a part in stimulating growth in our plants. \n֍\tIn a study conducted by the Royal Horticultural Society, research demonstrated that plants did respond to human voices\n֍\tBased on these different researches: Scientists developed an artificial sound treatment called Ultrasonication, this sonication treatment is fast, energy-saving, water-saving, also can elicit various effects in plants:\n1) Enhancement of seed germination percentage, seed vigour index (SVI), root and shoot lengths of seedlings, better plant growth and higher crop yields.\n2) Sound pretreatment enhances plant immunity against subsequent pathogen attacks by activating the plant defence hormones. \n3) Induction of abiotic stress tolerance, which affects the ability of plants to absorb water.\n4) Perturbation of ripening. \n5) Enhancement of the photosynthetic capacity; Sound treatment increases expression of photosynthesis-related genes, and may induce CO2 fixation.\n֍\tDepending on previous research, Wesal shall include a mini-ultrasonicator to translate our sound messages to signals easy for plant perception, enhancing communication and improving health.\n֍\tOn the other hand, by looking at existing related products, surprisingly found very technical pots or devices that you stick into the soil close to the plant. In both cases, the products were connecting to the user's phone via an app and compiling information to create graphs, analysis and later advise on the plant's care.\n֍\tAlso found self-sustaining domestic hydroponic systems for automated plant care, with little or without human interaction.\n֍\tWesal is so different, as it depends on strengthening the interaction bond between humans and plants, as real friends.\n֍\tWesal is a planter varying in shape according to various types of plants (green plant, flowering plant, cactus or orchid), holding an encyclopedia which informs us with each plant characteristics and conditions, so we can help them according to their needs.\n֍\tWesal is provided with hidden sensors capable of measuring humidity, light, temperature and soil conditions, then comparing its compatibility with every plant type and its required conditions. Wesal translates this information into reactions by the plant language.\n֍\tWesal enhances feedback from plants in a way that remains natural and simple to comprehend; with a voice \"sounded like a plant\", organic, delicate, natural. And cute facial expression - an expression that is unique to each plant, a personality; one that you need to understand over time, just like with a child.",

            "a1": "This design was inspired by our great balance of the ancient construction and carpentry of the muqarnas, arches, and eastern domes that appear in mosques and various buildings, with a combination of them with the industrial design line using rebar to give durability and sustainability to the design.\n\n The design was enhanced to be more balanced with velor fabrics in the royal green color used frequently in the art of the (Minator) and his old paintings. To complete the meaning, an elongated pillow was added that twins the shape of the sofa with a golden fabric embroidered with some (motifs) inspired by Behzad’s work and repeated in the golden miniature paintings that bear a legendary character  My stories have been used to revive it again and to soften the industrial constructivist impression of the sofa. I note here that this pillow has a special series that I designed with close knowledge in the world of miniature and gilding.\n\n In this design, I deliberately combined comfort, luxury, durability and modernity at the same time. With the trend of the majority of international designs towards comfort, practicality, clear lines and reducing details in the designs, there has become some repetition, so the uniqueness of the consumer with a distinct piece of furniture depends on the quality of manufacturing and the brand only, not on the aesthetic and difference.\n\n Unlike what happened in the last century.  Each piece has its own character and aesthetic feature, even if it is cheap and simple. For example, the guard’s seat in front of the building was a masterpiece that we acquire today to make a distinct and elegant corner, as well as the door of an old apartment in a neighborhood that did not enter services, but it carries within the folds the quality of the craft and the uniqueness of the decorations.  All the details of the furniture were not carved in vain, but rather to live for decades, bearing the imprint of the place and the identity of its people between its sides.\n\n In this design, I wanted to use the spirit of contemporary art in suggesting a meaning and a questionable thought by carving arches on natural wood that gives the design life and sustainability.  It is preferred to use manual sculpting with modernization of the style in order to employ the heritage and historical inheritance of aesthetics in furniture and fabrics. Some of the crafts that were unique to the East for a long time almost disappeared, such as muqarnas, domes, and manual sculpting in general, which needs someone to bring it back to life, secondly, through a modern recruitment that suits the modern vision and the difference  Lifestyle and living spaces, as the dimension of the contemporary trend in furniture design from the visual crowd and the tendency to (minimalist) does not mean that the spaces are devoid of aesthetic details, but rather it is more appropriate to employ them by reducing the quantity and accumulation that was previously used in furniture\n\n Innovation\n\n The design is an innovative approach to restore the cultural and aesthetic heritage to modern life with simple touches, with the help of the high capacity of the carving craft that characterizes the entire Damietta Governorate in Egypt, and also taking advantage of local embroidery, which is characterized by simple, fast lines with the renewal of its traditional style and adding new symbols to it.  The innovative trend in design brings up building arches with a modern sofa or the overlap of arabesques with (postmodern) or japandi furniture (or the symbols of Iranian carpets in their colors within the Scandinavian style (skandi).\n\n Sustainability\n\n The use of natural tree trunks without wasting.  For the beauty of its external appearance, it does not need to be finished except for some natural oils that show the beauty of wood inlays, which are environmentally friendly materials that give sustainability to the piece with the reuse of used rebar, which depends in its manufacture on recycling, by changing its function as a building squeezing and reconfiguring it to hold the base of the sofa, which gives the product durability  With a shortage of workers manufacturing the product",
            "a2": "Executive part\n\n The basic construction of the design is four legs of steel reinforcement with a wide iron support along the length of the sofa, carried on a wooden base and boxes for the two armrests.\n\n Hand carving on wood has been favored to carve (arches) on both sides, with a gradation in the details of the carving.  The edges of the wood are deliberately vandalized in order to show the beauty of the wood and give the effect of the old construction, taking into account the thickness of the wood in vandalism and drilling. A large part of the vandalism comes on the side supported by the base of the sofa, which is wood with a height that allows to show the accuracy of the carving.\n\n As for the types of wood used in the base, it is beech or walnut, taking into account the choice of the piece of wood used and the extent of its dryness with the diameter of the rebar and the bearing capacity in order to reach the best endurance and sustainability of the piece\n\n Using steel reinforcement in the four legs with an angled angle aims to make the base of the sofa more comfortable.  It is welded with an iron support along the wooden base.  The design follows the direction of industrial design featured with the coldness of metals that suit the progress of machines and industries, including an unconventional aesthetic concept that suggests making the impossible possible.\n\n As for the fabrics and upholstery in this design, the harmony of the lines with each other was taken into consideration. A high density foam was added to the design. The shape of the sponge was manipulated and stitched to harmonize the shape of the larch in line with (fluted finishes trend) as well as the armrests\n\n Product development from the profit and implementation side: What the design aims at is a balance between the use of the aesthetics of heritage and modernity, which has become possible with the adaptation of current technology to different materials. So, engineered wood, which is less expensive and much lighter, can now be used for carving, and it is possible to cut stainless steel into attractive shapes that consumers can afford. Several designs can emerge from this one, such as arches carved in nested tables with used iron or stainless steel to become a profitable product that is easy to present to the consumer\n\n One of the negative observations in the period when everyone was forced to stay at home due to the global Corona pandemic is that we all felt the need for a change inside the house in an attempt to find a comfortable aesthetic perspective within the space in which we live, This was for the purpose of recreation or as a matter of humor during our conversations via Zoom in which we felt the need for some aesthetics in the background, it is preferable that we first beautify the permanent backgrounds in our real life through innovation as well as through integrating modern concepts, such as by using modern curtains that reflect the beauty of the sun inspired by the old Arabesque windows, or seashells in interlocking tables, or adding a realistic effect to our image via a filter that has also images of a fanciful miniature with gilded sides.",

All by the help of adjustable seat heights and depths and lumbar support that gives ample support for the lower back so that your spine is in just the correct position to provide good posture. For further information the word ergonomic itself refers to improved chair support, and not a type of chair.\nOur inspiration?\nThe human body muscles and the statement interior space chair. \nWe want to combine the human body comfort and correct support of an ergonomic office chair in a luxurious way. Also putting into consideration the pressure points in a human body to add to the ordinary ergonomics of an office chair.\nHave you ever seen a lumbar support chair that is put as a luxury statement in a living room?\nOur fluka chair is a multi-function and multi-use chair that allows you to experience the full seating experience without any boredom or discomfort on a long term. Its as if you’re floating on a flying chair, which is exactly our aim.\nMultiple layers?\nWe were trying to come up with solutions to fix problems that people face every day in the office environment as it’s the only environment that people experience the discomfort and lack of support of chairs. Statistically people sit over 10 hours a day in their chairs at offices. Along with that we were also considering and trying to reach a luxurious statement chair form in a living space, so that the person can also benefit from a work at home friendly supportive chair that can give you the full office chair support experience. We looked at all kinds of chairs ball chairs and stools and we notice how unstable those are above this they didn't really fit into the office environment. The standard office chair and ordinary chairs really fight against what our bodies are naturally supposed to do we're built to move or kinetic! we're supposed to release energy! People sit in different ways all day long, therefore we designed this chair to help support your natural tendency to sit in different positions having a seat pan that is disconnected from the main body, which is very energetic, and energy and muscle freedom is what we wanted to capture on the design.

It helps to minimize heat transfer between the two outermost layers. If this layer isn’t present, the ambient temperature of the gel could cause heat loss from the body and feel cold while sitting. The thermal insulator isn’t the most glamorous part of the cooling, but it is an important one.\n\n3-Memory foam: \nHistory: First designed in the 1960’s for use in NASA spaceship seats and seatbelts, shock-absorbing, pressure-relieving memory foam has also been used as cushioning in helmets and shoes, and use in prosthetics and wheelchair seating pads.\nWhat is Memory Foam Made Of?\nBy the addition of many chemical compounds and additives to the polyurethane with a degree of polyether polyol , two of the main qualities of memory foam are affected: viscosity and elasticity.\n “viscous”, we mean that it takes a long time to change shape under pressure, or to transfer energy from one place to another. \n “elastic”, it means it can stretch or contort but return to its original shape or size when the stretching force is taken away,\nHow Does Memory Foam Work?\nAs we outlined above, memory foam is designed to slowly mold to the body in response to pressure, and as a result evenly distribute body weight and help the chair cushion the body evenly, creating the slow contouring feeling as the chair reforms around your curves. They are also designed to be resilient, and to return to their original shape once body weight and pressure is removed on an average of around 5-10 seconds. Over this period of time energy is absorbed and dissipated, which is a phenomenon known as “Hysteresis” that removes some of the pressure produced by the prone body.\n\nIf you apply pressure quickly, the foam tends to change shape more slowly, or “reluctantly.” \nThis means that memory foam is excellent at absorbing the force of an impact.\n\nMEMORY FOAM VISCOSITY IS INVERSLY PROPORTIONAL TO TEMPERATURE!\nAn important part of how our memory foam works is that its viscosity decreases as temperature increases. This means that it becomes less stiff and more flexible the hotter it gets, making it lose the character of returning back to its original form. WE CAME TO A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. \nBy the use of the cooling gel laminated layer the gel can balance the temperature and prevent it to heat up , which protects the memory form from deforming and giving the chair a longer life span. This makes the user feel cooled and comfortable throughout the whole seating experience.\n\n4-Final exterior Crepe layer: Crepe is a sustainable cotton-based textile that is a product of cellulose. The material is locally produced with best quality as Egypt is known for best cotton production in the world. The material has a comfortable and breathable feel that allows the cooling mechanism to work at its finest. The material also provides a silky finish to it giving it a luxurious feel to it.",

Because light bulbs that use LED technology are more environmentally friendly. 95% of the energy in LEDs is converted into light and only 5% is wasted as heat, hence, reduces greenhouse emissions from power plants. Roughly, one LED bulb will minimize greenhouse gas emissions by almost half a ton. One of the main reasons why LED light bulbs are considered so eco-friendly is the fact that they are designed to last much longer than conventional light bulbs. The fact that LEDs last longer means that fewer bulbs need to be produced, so they do not need to be replaced as often. Less is more when it comes to helping the environment; so the fact that fewer lights are needed means that fewer resources will be required for manufacturing, packaging, and transportation.",

Plants and flowers make people cheerful and improve their moods, improve concentration and productivity and relieve stress. This model invokes us to think about communication between nature and civilization.\n\nWith the Pressure of the modern life and the domination of working and stereotypical life, it becomes necessary to create unique items that restore the connection with nature and ancient civilizations. Energy savings and the creation of a clean environment that is environmentally friendly and has an authentic symbol were the basis of the idea of design.\n\nThe product is originally designed to put plants inside it and preserve plant life in the indoor environment by supplying them with light.

The Nile River is the origin of civilization and the secret of life for the Egyptians. In the Land of Egypt, it flows from Nuba and Aswan in the south to the delta and the Mediterranean Sea in the north. On its banks, the ancient Egyptian civilization grew up. So, in the Egyptian culture, the Nile is the source of life. It plays an important role in all fields and aspects of their lives and had a profound influence upon their environment. It shaped their culture and provided water, food, transportation, and excellent soil for growing food. It really preserves development and prosperity in Egypt.\n\nIn the modern era, The High Dam, which was built across the Nile in Aswan, Egypt between 1960 and 1970, is very important to the Egyptians life. It has resulted in protection from floods and droughts and increases agricultural production. One of the critical issues is generating enormous amounts of hydroelectric power in Egypt. The hydroelectric power generation relies mainly on this great dam. So, there is a uniquely strong relationship between water, electricity, and indeed life in Egypt. Water and energy are two sides of the same coin in Egypt.\n\nOn the other side, the Ankh-sometimes referred to as the key of life is a well-known symbol of eternal life in Ancient Egypt. It appears in abundance on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs and in the hieroglyphic writing and art. It was frequently depicted being held in gods' hands, representing their life-giving power in Egyptian belief. This Iconic original symbol gives a unique concept to the product.\n\nThe design structure is inspired by the map of Egypt as the Nile River is located between the eastern desert, Sinai desert, and the western desert on the other side of Egypt. Water is combined with wood, glass, and metal to create an impressive style. The Nile River waves, with their movement, were simulated in the blue twisted body in the center. The two glass vases on both sides allow plants and flowers to be arranged in them. Therefore, we also remember the map of Egypt when we see the glow head helps plants to grow like the Nile River has been helping Egypt to create its civilization. The decorative motifs in the base are inspired by the Nubian architectural style.\n\nProportion:\nThe product was designed in dimensions that fit its function as a planter light and a table lamp with harmonious proportions. We can also see the golden ratio in the design between the height of the glow head and the rest of the piece height.\n\nProperties:\nMaterials: Aluminum, Glass, Natural Wood.\nSize of product: Width 27cm x Depth 21cm x Height 52cm.",

In short, most of mesh produce are made of plastics, typically nylon or polypropylene. Although, it is a non-environmental material, it came to our surprise that it is even used in planting, some fishing techniques, bird haunting and maybe many other fields we have not stumbled upon yet. \n\nSince that point, all what we can think of is “what if this material is disposed in the sea?”. Not that we are disregarding street animals caught in this awful material by mistake too. But the sea, the waves, the fish, the corals was all what ran in the back of our minds.\n\nNo matter how many times we searched and researched, sketched and started modeling, we were definitely inspired by this beautiful sea life. \n\nSo, we got out our binoculars once again and had a look at this fascinating yet harsh material. This geometric genius material is expandable up to 100 times it’s size while closed, and takes the shape of whatever it holds. It is so functional, that you can even buy the reusable fabric version of it to use at the grocery, supermarkets, beach toys..etc.\n\nThe love and hate relationship we had towards this material, made us want to create a provocative object that will shed the light on the material’s consequences, and at the same time show off it’s geometric genius. \n\nWe have chosen to create a lighting unit to highlight the environmental problem that we might have been disregarding for a while. “Highlight in the light”\n\nThe SHED light is a suspended linear LED lighting fixture, that creates a water like ambient around the space it is fixed in. It is designed to fulfill some aspects you will be reading further.",
            "a2": "Product development is based on design thinking process; alternating between stages. \n\nWe started studying the mesh material, how it holds up weight and deforms, how it can reflect and diffuse light, and what can be it’s best representation material.\n\nThe Mesh: the pattern is made out of straight parallel lines connected repetitively together in certain points, creating a rhombus in the optimum stretch size. The more you stretch it, the more it turns to an irregular square. To the last stretching point, it forms a rounded rectangle with middle joints at the top and bottom. \n\nOur initial idea was to create the same mesh out of brass holding up light balls, like a net filled with 1kg of oranges. We have chosen brass to represent our heritage, and signify the Cairo’s street walk. \n\nThen came the provocative direction in one of our brainstorming sessions, to rotate the whole net and almost take out one of the bulbs as if it is falling. Thus, pushing the user to look twice, notice the object, and hopefully understand what it might be referring too. PROVOCATIVE was one of our first highlighted key word to work with. \n\nCOMPRESS & EXPAND, is the material’s behavior we are working with. We tried different applications for it; like a 2 action lighting unit; has an inside frame that can expand and contract. When it expands, the mesh turns into rounded rectangles so attached to each other thus dimming light. If the inside frame contracts, the mesh would then reach an optimum stretch size, and thus rhombuses can illuminate more light to the room. However, we couldn’t engage the sea life and evoking users in this phase. \n\nBut it turned out to be the best formula for A COMPACT SELLABLE PRODUCT, an attribute -we appreciated deeply- that came up in a later ideation session. We wanted to design a product that is taking into consideration the importance of product’s shipment process. \n\nAs many product designers, our eagerness to hold, feel and play around with this product was surfacing. We went out bought some brass rods and started our first prototype. Not for long, as it didn’t work for aesthetic reasons; the welding was showing, and wasn’t strong enough for compressing & expanding. We were successful with trying to find a substitute, a firmer aluminum rod in the jewelry market. With some jewelry tools and those rods we created our first material’s substitute mock-up. \n\nThis mock up made us realize that we need our customer to also interact with this provocative product. Maybe not all users would appreciate this feature, but surely it was an important aspect to our product ideation. “..shed the light on the material’s consequences, and at the same time show off it’s geometric genius.”\n\nUSER INTERACTION: to succeed in the user-object interaction, we had to have just the right constraints for the movement, to encourage the user to start shaping their own mesh that will suit their space.\n\nThe more we played with the mesh, the more we saw the fish’s silhouettes, scales & tails. The more we sketched, the more we had a closer eye on which designs are signifying a creature stuck or harmed, rather than the act of fishing.\n\nWe had finally reached our 4 different designs. Each has its own beauty and will signal differently to every person. We are sharing the most developed one, the SHED. \n\nSHED, is a biomimicry shaped lighting unit inspired by the plot of unconscious use of nylon mesh and the harm it causes to the environment. \n\nCustomer will receive SHED in a rectangular box (105L* 35W * 35H). The product consists of a long glass form, going through it the metal mesh, attached to it’s both ends the ceiling canopies. \n\nAs soon as the customer starts lifting it by the canopies, the mesh will begin to stretch out vertically, the glass form then will sit in it’s predesigned position, showing the material mesh expansion feature. In this stage, customers have the ability to expand and reform the mesh according to their preferences, but constraint with the glass form. Enjoy an ambient light coming from within the glass, providing a soft & even overall light to the space.",
            "q1": "Yes",
            "q2": "Improving product life cycle: In the mesh manufacturing process, we will be using metal rods, thus waste will be minimal as there is no cutting out from sheets or similar processes. The glass will be either hand made blown or press & blow, so as well no waste. SHED’s compact packing size will decrease the energy wasted in transportation; efficiently even in mass numbers, and reduce waste of broken products. Electricity energy will be efficiently used by adding LED lights-the electricity consumption of an LED light is 10 times lower, and has a 25 to 50 longer life than normal lights. Moving to disposal, it takes years for home owners, businesses or hotels to dispose a lighting units. If disposed, more than 95% of the material is biodegradable beside the wiring casing.  (as manufactured by suppliers)\n\nDesign to disassemble: products are designed to be easily disassembled, to have a chance to live a second or third life before recycled.\n\nSustainable Materials: we have managed to choose sustainable materials; glass & metal (maybe brass if we could find the right tension for expanding and contracting) that are non-toxic, easily reproduced, abundant, has low waste, biodegradable and can be recycled.",

Which what happened in the development phase; changing materials to abide to our concept. Our product is taking into consideration the manufacturing boundaries of the metal mesh material, blown glass and electrical sources. \n\nDistribution channels: we kept in mind the increasing number of SME’s and online shopping, by creating a compact sellable material. Which will be easily & safely transported from manufacture —> seller —> courier —> buyer. \n\nExternal Producers Bond: since it has direct impact on feasibility of the product manufacturing stage. We are eager to find the right producers to understand, and can see the design goal. From our previous experience from working with Kelos, they might be able to create this glass shape by hand blown technique. Or contact Walid Onsy, discovering the molding technique.",

Egyptian products were not known for their high quality only, but the mysterious Egyptian history exaggerated the desire to possess them. The time passed, and the passion faded, but the mystery remained and waited patiently to be wrapped with elegance one more time. The “BC³” represents a revival trail for the desire for Egyptian tobacco products through a Contemporary Vision of a Multifunctional Cigar Smoking Collection. The Egyptian visual artists usually express Egypt in the form of a peasant woman, as a gratitude for her rule through history, and to appreciate her extraordinary ability to adapt and overcome problems calmly. Accordingly, to present an Egyptian Cigar Smoking Collection in the form of an art piece, there is no better way than being inspired by the mental image of the Egyptian peasant woman. She always stands straight with perfect body lines and dynamic curves, carrying the Nile water in a pottery jar above her head while dressed up in a unique black Tally dress inlaid with silver threads.",

The entire realization process started with the preliminary studies and sketches, which focused on analyzing and extracting the proper sculpture lines inspired by the Egyptian Peasant Woman. Next was the construction material selection, which needed to be durable, replaceable, reusable, recyclable, and above all, can reflects the unique texture, patterns, and colors of the \"Tally Fabric.\" After that was the generation of the virtual prototype, which depended on a parametric design software with a unique script generated by the designer, to select the proper binder clips sizes and numbers for each sub-piece and the whole sculpture. Then, it was the time for constructing the semi-final prototype and testing its functionality performance, where the final amendments and adjustments took place, and finally, it was the time to collect the “BC³” sculpture into its final configuration.",

In addition to their unique environmental properties, binder clips are durable and reusable products, which means that after a long time of using it as a cigar-smoking collection, the user can disassemble the “BC³” for the last time to use the Binder Clips for their original function. The Stick-on Floor Protectors, which are used on connection points on sculpture and sub-pieces to protect them from slipping or scratching the surfaces, were selected to contain more than 70% recycled polyester to low the environmental impact.",

On one side, using it as a Sculpture represents a contemporary piece of art that can add a decorative touch to any modern theme or context. On the other side, using “BC³” as a cigar-smoking collection provides its owner with all the necessary pieces for a unique smoking experience. The fact that the final sculptural configuration shows no adhesive materials or permanent connections maximizes the dynamism and shape-shifting of the sculpture. The disassembling and reassembling processes depend only on the owner’s hand power to perform a Press and Release action on the Binders Handles.

The first factor is the construction technique, which depends on combining the Binder Bodies into the necessary sub-pieces via vis-versa interlocking and then uses the Binders Handles as construction tension members to collect the sub-pieces into the final configuration. The other factor focuses on the smoking experience itself, which usually ends by keeping the cigar-smoking pieces and accessories on the table or within a box; with the “BC³,” the owner can reassemble them back together to enjoy his unique piece of art once more.",

            "a2": "The idea behind the product is the E-motion,  The representation of the Energy in Motion.\n\nLet’s start by exploring a basic understanding of emotions that will likely be dramatically different than what you have believed up to this point. What we think of as emotion is the experience of energy moving through the body. This is generally felt as sensations of contraction such as tension or expansion such as calm. The Latin derivative for the word emotion, ‘emotere’, literally means energy in motion.\n\nIn itself, emotional energy is neutral. It is the feeling sensation and physiological reaction that makes a specific emotion positive or negative. In the painting it is represented either a negative or positive wave. Feeling is what you label as anger, sadness, joy or fear. It is then your interpretations or thoughts about emotional energy that give it meaning. \n\nEmotion serves as the carrier waves for the entire spectrum of feelings. Understanding that emotions are energy implies that they are fluid, moving resources meant to be felt and released vs. suppressed and ignored. The latter is the true culprit of low emotional intelligence and stress burnout.\n\nAs a result of these findings, the emotional brain is considered to have executive power in the brain. It influences all decision making, thought processes, memories, and present experiences. Your ability to understand, deal with, and effectively use your emotional energy is vital to your happiness levels.\n\nThe sensations you feel in your body hold the key to unlocking limiting patterns, transforming stress, and generating lasting happiness. Your body gives a constant stream of reliable information about your experience in the form of sensation. It’s a library of who you are at the deepest level, including all that has happened to you and all that you dream about. Understanding your body sensations will transform your life\nThe drive to move your emotional energy is present every moment because your nervous system is in constant pursuit of homeostasis. It’s on a mission 24/7 regulating the balance of your bodymind connection. This often includes your instinctual drive to be happy by releasing any pent-up stress. You have an opportunity to move your emotional energy each time you experience contraction, tension, or any other body sensations. They are the internal messages of your bodymind wisdom that draw you toward balance and happiness.\nGiven the understanding that emotion is actually energy in motion it is important to distinguish what it looks and feels like to increase your emotional awareness. Most people believe this looks like using their thinking mind to analyze, think about and talk about how they feel. Although this approach can bring initial awareness it is not effective in the long run. It is common from this approach to hinder the process of expressing and managing emotions. In doing so, it keeps the process of expression at the level of thought vs. actual feeling or energy movement. In order to successfully express emotion you have to move your emotional energy by identifying the sensations and releasing states of contraction.\nThe ability to feel a certain feeling and just move on to the other feeling without overthinking it, let it flow because the second you think about it, it drives from energy in motion to an emotion, then to a thought, then to a spoken word. You never need to underestimate the power of a spoken word.  Death and life are in the power of the tongue and those who love it will eat its fruit. What I am full of, my mouth will say. Speak blessings, your will should be aware that you have power in your words. Words are like seeds, and they grow with you subconsciously like a tree, that will sooner or later produce fruits.  \n\n“Let there be light, and there was light. – God said”",

People keep plants in their homes not only for aesthetic reasons but also because they evoke positive feelings and a happier state of mind.\n֍\tUnfortunately, some of us still have trouble taking care of plants; simply because they can’t talk our language to tell us their needs, which seems like it requires a sort of special sense or knowledge to understand their needs just by looking at them. Does she need more water or was the water too much? Was there no sunlight? Is her type requires indoor or outdoor caring conditions? Is a bigger suitable pot needed as she grows up? Are there any chewing insects or invading enemies? Does she suffer from pain or stress? Why did she not survive? These are all questions that many of us have had at one point in time or another and this is precisely what “Wesal” is trying to solve.\n֍\tWesal introduces the unique personality of each plant, representing plants with real funny characters.\n֍\tWesal creates a conversational mode, giving the chance to this seemingly mundane creature to express her feelings, to ask for attention if you have not paid attention to it for a while, and to react when spoken to with a cute face and expressive voice.\n֍\tWesal surrounds each personified plant with her perfect environment, providing her with all essential and supplementary conditions for healthy growing; from watering, minerals, lighting, pH levels and temperature, to surrounding her with entertaining and calming music.\n֍\tWesal aims to prove that plant is the best friend for us from kids to elders, lonely or social, busy or free-scheduled, lacking a green thumb or gardening professionals.\n֍\tWesal aims also to enhance people behaviour with morals as the plant rises in front of them; such as Mercy, Beauty of caring, giving unconditionally, sustaining our green ecosystem with gratitude for precious gifts: water, Sun, and Mother Earth.",
            "a2": "My product began with an imaginative idea as I was talking to my recuperating plant, then wondering: Oh! Did she hear me? Oh! Did she reply to my words? Oh! Did she feel my sadness when she was sick?; Yes, I’m sure she does. But how can I prove it?\n֍\tSo I began to research and found several studies showing that researchers have been able to document plant sounds using sensors and electrodes. They have found different responses when they are in pain or thirsty.\n֍\tSome biological studies indicate that plants are highly sensitive organisms that generate and react to sound signals from their environment.\n֍\tExperiments found that specific frequencies of bee buzzing facilitate the pollination of flowers. In addition, recorded insect chewing sounds induce the production of chemicals related to plant defence. So, plants respond to insects through sound, either serving as warning signals or beneficial signals to the plant.\n֍\tHowever, the specific organs or proteins used for sound perception have not yet been identified, cutting-edge technology now believes that plants can indeed benefit from sound through their mechanosensory machinery. \n֍\tRecent studies using ‘omics’ technologies, such as transcriptome and proteomic analyses, showed that proper sound treatment has a positive effect on plant growth, as they exhibit transcriptional and hormonal changes in response to sound wave treatment.\n֍\tPlant hormones typically regulate plant cellular processes and orchestrate most aspects of plant physiology including plant growth, flowering, ripening, senescence, and defence responses, sound-induced hormonal changes might increase plant growth and provide strong resistance against biotic or abiotic stress. \n֍\tResearch by South Korea’s National Institute of Agricultural Biotechnology shows that: plants begin to react to sound at 70 decibels. Lucky for us, 70 decibels is the sound level for the average human conversation. Speaking, playing music and natural sound waves and vibrations provided from the environment all play a part in stimulating growth in our plants. \n֍\tIn a study conducted by the Royal Horticultural Society, research demonstrated that plants did respond to human voices\n֍\tBased on these different researches: Scientists developed an artificial sound treatment called Ultrasonication, this sonication treatment is fast, energy-saving, water-saving, also can elicit various effects in plants:\n1) Enhancement of seed germination percentage, seed vigour index (SVI), root and shoot lengths of seedlings, better plant growth and higher crop yields.\n2) Sound pretreatment enhances plant immunity against subsequent pathogen attacks by activating the plant defence hormones. \n3) Induction of abiotic stress tolerance, which affects the ability of plants to absorb water.\n4) Perturbation of ripening. \n5) Enhancement of the photosynthetic capacity; Sound treatment increases expression of photosynthesis-related genes, and may induce CO2 fixation.\n֍\tDepending on previous research, Wesal shall include a mini-ultrasonicator to translate our sound messages to signals easy for plant perception, enhancing communication and improving health.\n֍\tOn the other hand, by looking at existing related products, surprisingly found very technical pots or devices that you stick into the soil close to the plant. In both cases, the products were connecting to the user's phone via an app and compiling information to create graphs, analysis and later advise on the plant's care.\n֍\tAlso found self-sustaining domestic hydroponic systems for automated plant care, with little or without human interaction.\n֍\tWesal is so different, as it depends on strengthening the interaction bond between humans and plants, as real friends.\n֍\tWesal is a planter varying in shape according to various types of plants (green plant, flowering plant, cactus or orchid), holding an encyclopedia which informs us with each plant characteristics and conditions, so we can help them according to their needs.\n֍\tWesal is provided with hidden sensors capable of measuring humidity, light, temperature and soil conditions, then comparing its compatibility with every plant type and its required conditions. Wesal translates this information into reactions by the plant language.\n֍\tWesal enhances feedback from plants in a way that remains natural and simple to comprehend; with a voice \"sounded like a plant\", organic, delicate, natural.

The Nile River is the origin of civilization and the secret of life for the Egyptians. In the Land of Egypt, it flows from Nuba and Aswan in the south to the delta and the Mediterranean Sea in the north. On its banks, the ancient Egyptian civilization grew up. So, in the Egyptian culture, the Nile is the source of life. It plays an important role in all fields and aspects of their lives and had a profound influence upon their environment. It shaped their culture and provided water, food, transportation, and excellent soil for growing food. It really preserves development and prosperity in Egypt.\n\nIn the modern era, The High Dam, which was built across the Nile in Aswan, Egypt between 1960 and 1970, is very important to the Egyptians life. It has resulted in protection from floods and droughts and increases agricultural production. One of the critical issues is generating enormous amounts of hydroelectric power in Egypt. The hydroelectric power generation relies mainly on this great dam. So, there is a uniquely strong relationship between water, electricity, and indeed life in Egypt. Water and energy are two sides of the same coin in Egypt.\n\nOn the other side, the Ankh-sometimes referred to as the key of life is a well-known symbol of eternal life in Ancient Egypt. It appears in abundance on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs and in the hieroglyphic writing and art. It was frequently depicted being held in gods' hands, representing their life-giving power in Egyptian belief. This Iconic original symbol gives a unique concept to the product.\n\nThe design structure is inspired by the map of Egypt as the Nile River is located between the eastern desert, Sinai desert, and the western desert on the other side of Egypt. Water is combined with wood, glass, and metal to create an impressive style. The Nile River waves, with their movement, were simulated in the blue twisted body in the center. The two glass vases on both sides allow plants and flowers to be arranged in them. Therefore, we also remember the map of Egypt when we see the glow head helps plants to grow like the Nile River has been helping Egypt to create its civilization. The decorative motifs in the base are inspired by the Nubian architectural style.\n\nProportion:\nThe product was designed in dimensions that fit its function as a planter light and a table lamp with harmonious proportions.

When we reach the desired color, apply it to all the handmade tiles of the mihrab.\n9-\tFire the glaze on a 1050-degree C\n10-\tAfter fire and when it is cooled down, it’s time to gather the pieces together and wood frame it for the final product to use.\n11-\tFor mirror add a mirror in the middle and gather only the frame \n12-\tFor wall fountain add a water tub from ceramic or copper and a handmade sink.",

We use locally sourced clay as the raw material.\nOne of the best qualities about ceramics is that they are truly a natural product. Ceramics all start with clay, which is a naturally malleable material composed of minerals and water.\nThe mineral bodies in ceramic clay are abundant and sourced from the earth, next to the banks of river Nile or from special desert places. We create products that are handmade, shaped and carved by hand and drawing underglaze and over glaze. When fired in a kiln, it can last a lifetime or longer. (Ceramic and Pottery from Pharaonic, Coptic and Islamic ancestors are still standing till now). Both natural and food-safe, ceramic dinnerware, tiles, tray is significantly more sustainable than plastics, the latter can actually leak toxins into the food we eat and water we drink.\nThe ceramic industry has, for many years, performed important technological and managerial improvements to tackle environmental aspects of the manufacturing phase. Ceramic tiles can be crushed and then used in a range of different applications, like concrete aggregates or road construction, turning the waste become a resource.\nOur products are environmentally-friendly throughout their manufacturing process.\nWe use more natural resources, in a way they last indefinitely, we use natural Aswan clay and chemicals for colors above it a glaze material which is very safe for use burned in a very high temperature to insure safety and strong tiles.\n We offer elegant pieces which are made using sustainable production methods with respect for both the environment and the artists who create them. They do not contain harmful chemicals like cadmium or lead. \nWe are proud to announce that all of our glazes are food-safe, lead-free\nNatural mineral clay is an excellent resource for creating beautiful, safe and sustainable pieces you can feel good about using in your home.",

Letting these stories fade hinders our development. That’s why I decided to bring them to life in a way that copes with the present.\nA legendary touch from the past blends with the new art creating this exceptional piece that tells a-lot.\n\n639 CE until the brief end of the 16th century marked the great Islamic era which was led by Amr Ibn el As on Egypt. \nThis era was a great transformation in the Egyptian history and it lies between the two alternative dynasties that together formed the great and magnificent Egyptian history. This era was one in which Egypt cast off the heritage of the past to embrace a new culture in which Egyptian Islamic civilization evolved. During that period Egypt was part of a great world empire. \n\nMy product is a one that glorifies and praises the great Islamic era.

I went home and started to research about the islamic empire, how they dressed, the colors they use, the patterns and the products they created for living.\n\nAfter tons of researches and sleepless nights my gallery was filled with astonishing mosques, architectures, kilim carpets, outfits of rulers and loads of potteries. With one common element which was fine smooth curves with hints of blue, it took me few seconds to research why blue? Then I realised that books were created explaining the reason behind it. It was proven that blue is the sign of cleanness and spirituality back then. In the architecture of Islamic mosques the colors blue and turquois blue are used abundantly. The traditional people believed in the holiness of turquoise blue. They integrated blue within almost each and every piece. \n\nWhile brainstorming my product that will speak out this story I decided to add a hint of turquoise blue making it  one of my primary colors in my color palette. And because Water is what makes us humans, water bottle was my inspiration to create my story.\n\nGlass is aesthetically appealing material made out of sand, hygiene substance created out of raw material, reusable and recyclable well know with it’s transparency, dust resistance and color availability. \nIt is the best match for water and to be placed in interiors including homes. \n\n60% of the human body is water, water defines us, it creates the body shape. the soothing water waves that is created when the water is poured in a flask or a cup is another feature that I wanted to add in my design. the perfect curved waves that are created resemble the human body’s curves and spirality, these when added to my design create a remarkable perspective. and that’s together with the nude effect and water blue are elements that I wanted to integrate in my product. \nAfter gathering enough knowledge to start, I decided to design a water bottle out of glass. While adding inspirations from the islamic art as the cap that was inspired from the sultans hats during this era in addition to hint of turquoise blue to compliment the water effect. Also it’s shape is inspired from the water potteries and it has curves that remains people of the human body creation.\n\nIt took two weeks of hard work and insistence along with excitement to define the final shape, I started by adding a tracing papers into my sketchbook and started to recreate the lines till I felt this shape was the most suitable one. After that I created a mood board using the colors I previously mentioned and the vibes I wanted to deliver. Then I took my design and started to 3D model my product into ratio of 1:1 in rhino 3D and renders in keyshot.

Knowing that made me insist more to make my design a handcrafted one. I went to gamaleya street and I met with one of the glassblowers, I showed him the design I have created and surprisingly he implemented it without any flaws. It was a piece of art. I was astonished. The way he takes control of the glass and shapes it before the glass cools under a curtain temperature is an innovation that I would like it to keep living on.

Our force to adapt to this lifestyle is influencing our choices even when people start furnishing their homes.\n\n\nWe recently noticed that a lot of homes are modern and mostly look alike. That is because they are not done by the choices of house owners yet delegated to firms, which is not something bad but it’s the trend that lead to identityless look n feel homes. On the other hand, consumers when come across a modern authentic design, they stop and shop. That is the driver that contributed to the success of Egyptian brands like Azza Fahmy, Joud, and many more local brands. \n\nAgain, this new lifestyle we are living in 2021 created a need for taste and art. It also created an appreciation for identity at home. Local brands started to flourish and consumers adopted a product with their identity when it was designed with an accent of the world they are living in. As a result of the love of art flourishing it became an important element in networking events acting as an icebreaker. This is exactly why we chose dining setups products to tap on reaching our vision and mission because where do people network? What products do they they use or can create a look n feel to make their network unique? At Casa Mia we find that the dining table setup creates all the mood and is an important pillar. That is why we created a product authentically designed yet modern.\n\nSo we tapped on two key players in all homes to try to spread our vision and mission through, which are kids bedrooms and dinning tables. But not dining tables as furniture, it is the dining setup that speaks most in all hospitality setups.\n\n\nLets tell you the story about our tablecloths and how significant they are as a product before answering your self evaluation questions.\n\n\nOur tablecloths are our tool in spreading a authenticity/identity at homes. So we chose Abdeen palace as our inspiration for one of our collection. As it is full of art from different historical eras for egypt like Byzantine patterns, Mamluk pattern, Islamic patterns, European patterns and many more. Egypt learnt art from different nationalities, it was a cosmopolitan country so we have lovely patterns and lines earned over many years to show the world.",

In addition my cousin published a book reciting the architecture and interior of the palace as I read it I fell in love with the art in it especially when I read that it was done based on intentional artistic display of Egyptian era. A hall with Byzantine art, neo-Islamic (al haramlek), jardin d’hiver, from here I started reading about the patterns history and started to combine patterns and diffuse it to create new ones in a modern context. I sketch the pattern with its proportions on the table manually first then I scan it on photoshop and start applying it to create the final product to be printed on cloth.\nAnother research we did is the material used. We had several fabrics options and weight, as fabrics vary in weight as well. We chose a material that fits modern lifestyle which is “fast” easy to wash and iron, doesn’t require too much effort.\nLast step in the product development was the packaging how will it be delivered to the customer and the branding we want putting in mind being environmentally friendly. So we chose paper bags and paper boxes in addition to a card stating the story of the design, so we can spread the heritage and art among our society.",

Thats why when we sell the tablecloth we write its story so it could act like a piece of art hung on the wall and by that achieve our primary goal is heritage in an artisanal way. \nThat’s why we chose the dining table, the most element that witnesses networking in the house.In modern houses clients used the tablecloth for the buffet table acting it as a decorative and centerpiece of the event.\nThis product can impact the F&B business for dining in an artisanal way.\nThe material used is heavy duty for several usages, washes and  hot serving as well as the design is creating the objective of the product which is spreading authenticity in a contemporary and artisanal way. consequently setting a unique mood for a hospitality with a story to offer for attendees. For example when you have a piece of art hung on the wall you it acts like an ice breaker for the event and creates harmony in the event. Our tablecloths achieve this by testimonials by clients.

Our tablecloths are sold with card stating the story behind the design as a help for the client to spread the word.\nAlso, the creativity here is in the combination of several patterns in the palace from several places in creating the final design exactly like a piece of drawing. In addition to the choice of combining it with runners of a totally different pattern from a different place in the palace to tell more stories about our lines that we learnt across history.\nLast but not least the element of keeping the hand drawing look and feel on photoshop was hard to implement.\nAs you can see our logo is a typography and flowers drawn with a paint brush because the brand identity is all about appreciating  art and craft be it old or modern. Even when we designed the tablecloths we drew it by hand and turned it digital I kept the lines not perfectly drawn or sharp like computer does so as to be consistent with brand identity. Therefore the images we were keen to be consistent with is the hand paint look and we took into consideration the colors to be adapting to the globalized world\nThough these designs are inspired by real art but there is room to abstract these designs further.\n\nIn our current age of mass production, group think, and homogenized globalization, a lot of people can copy but oddly enough (since we really are all unique), not many people can produce work with a unique voice.\nI believe our product is unique because tackling a heritage that hasn’t been highlighted and using its art in a modern setup.\n\nAlso using patterns in the palace that rarely someone can notice. Like a special part in a chandelier combined with the glass window pattern. So not only we were inspired by the artifact and an art that is already there but we did a combination of lines to produce a unique pattern and design.",

It’s a simple process yet with too many details to reach the look you want.\nThe photoshop could have influenced the look of hand drawn but we managed to keep the lines not straight so as to give the effect of drawing. So we mastered the computer influence. This process might take weeks.\nWe keep printing the final design several times for touches and try several color palettes specifically computer printing versus production printing. For colors they differ big time in the look you want to deliver. Sometimes on the printer it’s great but on the fabric it’s not and vice versa.\nLast step that was tricky to be applied skillfully were the colors in printing versus computer and type of fabric. We had to print on many fabrics and different weight of fabrics to reach to this product at the moment. But all the fabrics are locally produced.\nWe even have the runners on a different fabric type and thickness other than the tablecloths.",

            "a1": "This design was inspired by our great balance of the ancient construction and carpentry of the muqarnas, arches, and eastern domes that appear in mosques and various buildings, with a combination of them with the industrial design line using rebar to give durability and sustainability to the design.\n\n The design was enhanced to be more balanced with velor fabrics in the royal green color used frequently in the art of the (Minator) and his old paintings. To complete the meaning, an elongated pillow was added that twins the shape of the sofa with a golden fabric embroidered with some (motifs) inspired by Behzad’s work and repeated in the golden miniature paintings that bear a legendary character  My stories have been used to revive it again and to soften the industrial constructivist impression of the sofa. I note here that this pillow has a special series that I designed with close knowledge in the world of miniature and gilding.\n\n In this design, I deliberately combined comfort, luxury, durability and modernity at the same time. With the trend of the majority of international designs towards comfort, practicality, clear lines and reducing details in the designs, there has become some repetition, so the uniqueness of the consumer with a distinct piece of furniture depends on the quality of manufacturing and the brand only, not on the aesthetic and difference.\n\n Unlike what happened in the last century.  Each piece has its own character and aesthetic feature, even if it is cheap and simple. For example, the guard’s seat in front of the building was a masterpiece that we acquire today to make a distinct and elegant corner, as well as the door of an old apartment in a neighborhood that did not enter services, but it carries within the folds the quality of the craft and the uniqueness of the decorations.  All the details of the furniture were not carved in vain, but rather to live for decades, bearing the imprint of the place and the identity of its people between its sides.\n\n In this design, I wanted to use the spirit of contemporary art in suggesting a meaning and a questionable thought by carving arches on natural wood that gives the design life and sustainability.  It is preferred to use manual sculpting with modernization of the style in order to employ the heritage and historical inheritance of aesthetics in furniture and fabrics. Some of the crafts that were unique to the East for a long time almost disappeared, such as muqarnas, domes, and manual sculpting in general, which needs someone to bring it back to life, secondly, through a modern recruitment that suits the modern vision and the difference  Lifestyle and living spaces, as the dimension of the contemporary trend in furniture design from the visual crowd and the tendency to (minimalist) does not mean that the spaces are devoid of aesthetic details, but rather it is more appropriate to employ them by reducing the quantity and accumulation that was previously used in furniture\n\n Innovation\n\n The design is an innovative approach to restore the cultural and aesthetic heritage to modern life with simple touches, with the help of the high capacity of the carving craft that characterizes the entire Damietta Governorate in Egypt, and also taking advantage of local embroidery, which is characterized by simple, fast lines with the renewal of its traditional style and adding new symbols to it.  The innovative trend in design brings up building arches with a modern sofa or the overlap of arabesques with (postmodern) or japandi furniture (or the symbols of Iranian carpets in their colors within the Scandinavian style (skandi).\n\n Sustainability\n\n The use of natural tree trunks without wasting.  For the beauty of its external appearance, it does not need to be finished except for some natural oils that show the beauty of wood inlays, which are environmentally friendly materials that give sustainability to the piece with the reuse of used rebar, which depends in its manufacture on recycling, by changing its function as a building squeezing and reconfiguring it to hold the base of the sofa, which gives the product durability  With a shortage of workers manufacturing the product",
            "a2": "Executive part\n\n The basic construction of the design is four legs of steel reinforcement with a wide iron support along the length of the sofa, carried on a wooden base and boxes for the two armrests.\n\n Hand carving on wood has been favored to carve (arches) on both sides, with a gradation in the details of the carving.  The edges of the wood are deliberately vandalized in order to show the beauty of the wood and give the effect of the old construction, taking into account the thickness of the wood in vandalism and drilling. A large part of the vandalism comes on the side supported by the base of the sofa, which is wood with a height that allows to show the accuracy of the carving.\n\n As for the types of wood used in the base, it is beech or walnut, taking into account the choice of the piece of wood used and the extent of its dryness with the diameter of the rebar and the bearing capacity in order to reach the best endurance and sustainability of the piece\n\n Using steel reinforcement in the four legs with an angled angle aims to make the base of the sofa more comfortable.  It is welded with an iron support along the wooden base.  The design follows the direction of industrial design featured with the coldness of metals that suit the progress of machines and industries, including an unconventional aesthetic concept that suggests making the impossible possible.\n\n As for the fabrics and upholstery in this design, the harmony of the lines with each other was taken into consideration. A high density foam was added to the design. The shape of the sponge was manipulated and stitched to harmonize the shape of the larch in line with (fluted finishes trend) as well as the armrests\n\n Product development from the profit and implementation side: What the design aims at is a balance between the use of the aesthetics of heritage and modernity, which has become possible with the adaptation of current technology to different materials. So, engineered wood, which is less expensive and much lighter, can now be used for carving, and it is possible to cut stainless steel into attractive shapes that consumers can afford. Several designs can emerge from this one, such as arches carved in nested tables with used iron or stainless steel to become a profitable product that is easy to present to the consumer\n\n One of the negative observations in the period when everyone was forced to stay at home due to the global Corona pandemic is that we all felt the need for a change inside the house in an attempt to find a comfortable aesthetic perspective within the space in which we live, This was for the purpose of recreation or as a matter of humor during our conversations via Zoom in which we felt the need for some aesthetics in the background, it is preferable that we first beautify the permanent backgrounds in our real life through innovation as well as through integrating modern concepts, such as by using modern curtains that reflect the beauty of the sun inspired by the old Arabesque windows, or seashells in interlocking tables, or adding a realistic effect to our image via a filter that has also images of a fanciful miniature with gilded sides.",

Although it is challenging to perceive such a topic, digging deeper into it and knowing the reasons behind it would be quite interesting. I hope to achieve a big step towards my goal in improving people's lives. Since production plays a huge factor in human evolution, as production originated from the beginning of time. It started from simple tools using rocks to cut trees or harvest fruits and vegetables, reaching to the manufacturing of power stations that generates energy for numerous usages. Power stations generate the energy needed for the production process. However, this energy used for production is limited, as materials are limited. There are different methods of generating energies which can be divided into two major sources. Non-renewable energy sources, like fossil fuel, coal, nuclear and natural gas. And renewable energy sources, like solar, hydropower, biomass, wind, and geothermal. According to British Petroleum’s statistical reviews of World Energy in 2019, the usage of renewable energy is only about 15.29%, while the rest is non-renewable energy sources. There is also a huge amount of energy wasted in the production process. As this process starts with the extraction of material in nature, then storing it, shipping it, using it to produce goods and services, consuming it, and finally recycling it. At each stage of the process, an amount of energy has to be used into the good or service to push it to the next stage of what it becomes. Therefore, in order for the extracted material to reach the next stage which is storage, an amount of energy is needed for this cycle. In each cycle of this conversion, part of the energy is lost. On another standpoint, there are also some materials that cannot be recycled after consumption. In this situation, corporates try their best to stay up to date with the advancement; by utilizing their Research & Development departments. Accordingly, newer products are introduced to the market on a fast pace. So, overproduction of goods occurs; risking the insufficient resources of the planet. It had always been an intriguing question knowing how the world would be affected if overproduction decreased! \n\nThe research methodology is a contribution of applied, explanatory and inductive categories. In which, an applied research is aimed at improving products, methods and procedures, while the goal of explanatory research is explaining a clear problem’s causes and consequences, and a inductive research is dedicated on developing a new concept associated with the research findings. The next step would be approaching the research data process. The project’s plan is to utilize secondary data which has already been collected by other researchers and designers. In addition, it would be a concentration on a mixed research method of both qualitative and quantitative types as it would focus on both meanings and statistics.

            "a1": "Around the mid-19th century, luxury Egyptian tobacco brands and accessories spread out across the world. Egyptian products were not known for their high quality only, but the mysterious Egyptian history exaggerated the desire to possess them. The time passed, and the passion faded, but the mystery remained and waited patiently to be wrapped with elegance one more time. The “BC³” represents a revival trail for the desire for Egyptian tobacco products through a Contemporary Vision of a Multifunctional Cigar Smoking Collection. The Egyptian visual artists usually express Egypt in the form of a peasant woman, as a gratitude for her rule through history, and to appreciate her extraordinary ability to adapt and overcome problems calmly. Accordingly, to present an Egyptian Cigar Smoking Collection in the form of an art piece, there is no better way than being inspired by the mental image of the Egyptian peasant woman. She always stands straight with perfect body lines and dynamic curves, carrying the Nile water in a pottery jar above her head while dressed up in a unique black Tally dress inlaid with silver threads.",
            "a2": "The “BC³” is a functional sculpture made out of various Binder Clips sizes and assembled manually into a dynamic piece of art, which yet can be disassembled into the necessary sub-pieces for cigar-smoking, including Ashtray, Cup Side Holder, Handgrip Holder, Rest Stand, and Accessories Stand, in addition to Owner's Manual Holder. The entire realization process started with the preliminary studies and sketches, which focused on analyzing and extracting the proper sculpture lines inspired by the Egyptian Peasant Woman. Next was the construction material selection, which needed to be durable, replaceable, reusable, recyclable, and above all, can reflects the unique texture, patterns, and colors of the \"Tally Fabric.\" After that was the generation of the virtual prototype, which depended on a parametric design software with a unique script generated by the designer, to select the proper binder clips sizes and numbers for each sub-piece and the whole sculpture. Then, it was the time for constructing the semi-final prototype and testing its functionality performance, where the final amendments and adjustments took place, and finally, it was the time to collect the “BC³” sculpture into its final configuration.",

            "q2": "The “BC³” configuration depends mainly on Binder Clips as a construction material, which in turn are made totally out of metal. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), metal binder clips are 100% recyclable and biodegradable products compared to plastic ones. In addition to their unique environmental properties, binder clips are durable and reusable products, which means that after a long time of using it as a cigar-smoking collection, the user can disassemble the “BC³” for the last time to use the Binder Clips for their original function. The Stick-on Floor Protectors, which are used on connection points on sculpture and sub-pieces to protect them from slipping or scratching the surfaces, were selected to contain more than 70% recycled polyester to low the environmental impact.",

            "q4": "What is unique about “BC³” is a multifunctional product. On one side, using it as a Sculpture represents a contemporary piece of art that can add a decorative touch to any modern theme or context. On the other side, using “BC³” as a cigar-smoking collection provides its owner with all the necessary pieces for a unique smoking experience. The fact that the final sculptural configuration shows no adhesive materials or permanent connections maximizes the dynamism and shape-shifting of the sculpture. The disassembling and reassembling processes depend only on the owner’s hand power to perform a Press and Release action on the Binders Handles. With the appropriate instructions, the owner can master both processes to take only 5 minutes.",

            "q6": "Besides selecting the Egyptian Peasant Woman as a theme to inspire the final \"BC3\" configuration and using Binder Clips as a durable construction material that can mimic the Tally Fabric, two main unconventional factors make “BC³” a unique product. The first factor is the construction technique, which depends on combining the Binder Bodies into the necessary sub-pieces via vis-versa interlocking and then uses the Binders Handles as construction tension members to collect the sub-pieces into the final configuration. The other factor focuses on the smoking experience itself, which usually ends by keeping the cigar-smoking pieces and accessories on the table or within a box; with the “BC³,” the owner can reassemble them back together to enjoy his unique piece of art once more.",

Linear economies were based on products being discarded at the end of their lifecycle. Mostly in landfills that waste, both the valuable resources and land, lead to environmental catastrophes. The transition to be more sustainable, a circular economy has been initiated but needs to be adapted by designers and consumers alike.\n\nThis model empowers reuse, recovery, and recycling during the design. Extending on this notion and using abundant material like paper, such a material life cycle could be lengthened, and the landfill disposal date could be postponed. This can be accomplished by diversifying the final product to suit the stage of recycling. As the paper is continuously recycled, it reaches a redundant stage where it is no longer possible to use it in creating the paper. Propositions such as the manufacture of paper brick fill in, significantly stretching the life of the material.\n\nWith the increasing percentage of paper recycling in developed countries such as the UK, Germany, and Finland, the engineering, economic and environmental aspects of paper waste recycling are therefore analyzed for the production of composite primary building materials such as bricks as paper waste acts as a raw reusable material for a lot of end products with different added value.",

At that point, landfill is the only option and to the detriment of our natural ecology. This project brings awareness of paper use and reuses by directing bales of paper destined to contaminate our environment for construction purposes.\n\nThe paper is gathered from recycling points in the local community. It is then rolled, folded and refolded into pre-made steel moulds. The paper is then compressed under 15 tons of pressure and the resulting compression of the different types, thicknesses and colours of paper creates a striped and variegated grain not unlike, but different from its original wood. The paper is compressed into bricks and blocks.\n\nThere are two mainstreams developed from four different prototypes. For the initial study, there are prototypes made of shredded paper, rolling paper, folding paper and crumpled paper. \nAfter testing and studying, the folding system and rolling system are developed with digital experiments and simulation. It is noticed that all prototypes can present the different methods and angels of circular economy and reduce the natural material resource consumption.",

You’ll find sustainable floor that is made of bamboo as wood material, island or tropical inspired furniture, rustic accessories, textile, lighting decorations and more. it’s easy to grow, harvest and transport so it is a popular choice of building material. Its properties also made it an excellent material to use. I wanted the wall accessory to be inspired from tropical style and used the Egyptian heritage so I used bamboo in different shapes and thickness , putting them layers to have 3d overlapping effect and illusion to add texture on the wall .The aesthetic unique shapes of the bamboo canes will add some nature , tropical character to the furniture and you could also use it indoors to define a space and create a tropical style that calls back to the past. this is an additional modern use of bamboo, it owes its origin to historical bamboo structures. You’ll get the benefits of modern construction with the look of the tropical rustic building material to add interest to any corner space. Ancient Egyptian civilization is one of the oldest cultures in human history and They believed that their earthly presence was only a part of their eternal journey and that death was only the beginning of a new chapter in another world. Ancient Egyptians are well-known for pioneering the fields of art . Ancient Egyptians gave us an opportunity to see thousands of beautiful texts written with images. Their unified aesthetics made it possible for complex texts to become readable and pleasant to look at. It created harmony within all of the hieroglyphs no matter who the writer was.\n\nThe Main Assets :\nin ancient Egypt eye of Horus represent protection and health.\nAccording to ancient Egyptian myth, Horus lost his left eye and the eye was magically protected by Hathor so the symbol was often used in pendants. Horus, the Egyptian Horus in ancient Egyptian religion is a god in the form of a falcon whose left eye was the moon representing healing, power and protection especially in tombs .\n\nAton, also spelled Aten, in Ancient Egyptian religion, a sun god, represented as the solar disk emitting rays ending with human hands.\n\nThe ankh is the most well-known symbol to come out of ancient Egypt it’s general meaning of the symbol in its hieroglyphic system of writing the ankh represents the concept of eternal life, The Ankh appears in Egyptian tomb paintings and art, It is known as “the key of the Nile”.\n\nAncient Egyptian symbols have affected life in ancient Egypt which was a fusion between the spiritual and the physical that showed in the form of artistic architecture, symbols and many objects that were used to bring good wealth and protection. These ancient Egyptian Symbols played an important role in passing the culture from one generation to another, as they were written on temple walls and obelisks . The Egyptian symbols were depicted in the form of hieroglyphs and used  as The Words of Gods which was used to document the most important events in ancient Egyptian History, their spiritual beliefs, and culture. \n\nThe ancient style I used :\n\nThe pure style is characterized by loyalty and attention of the nature of details and bright colors so I used main objects as eye of horus , key of life and sun god and used hieroglyphic patterns and their artistic symbols , It was widely used on the walls of public buildings. This style also incorporated painting, however it is decoratively , it didn’t lose their initial informative purpose.\n\nThe art direction :\n\nI used the flow of movement and direction, which lead the eye from one part of the composition to another in the direction from the eye of horus and Aton to the ankh then back to eye of Horus and Aton ( the son god ) . I created the flow through the combination of visual weight , depth and visual direction. Also I used repetition that works with pattern to make the work seem active and creates unity .\n\nBamboo has an unique wood texture with brownish green color paint that can add a touch of tropical style on the wall and it creates visual tone and attracts our sense of touch .\n\nEmphasized the value of the lightness and the darkness by the quantity of dashes .\n\nUse the Balance in weight by controlling the thickness and length of the bamboo pieces and the variety of the sizes of the objects .\n\nRepetition using historical hieroglyphic pattern to make the work seems active and creates unity also creates harmony between all parts of the artwork .",
            "a2": "The reason why I used bamboo\nIt has shallow roots so it would be easy to cut in different sizes and thickness to achieve the shadows and lights in the design\neco-friendly and durable to the environment. Bamboo products have become popular in recent years as people are becoming more and more eco-friendly and want to support eco-friendly homes also we used eco friendly transparent adhesive , jute background (kheish) and green ecofriendly paint .\n\nits antibacterial and Its strength, This means you do not have to use any chemicals on your bamboo interior piece, it will remove any bacteria found on its surface by itself.\n\nIts flexibility: Bamboo bends without breaking. Bamboo bends with external force instead of breaking and can return to its original shape. Its flexibility also makes bamboo useful for curved parts.\n\nInnovation of local material . it is a combination of providing high quality interior designs and still being able to support the local communities where the bamboo furniture is made.\n\nIt lasts for years and it is water resistant as it lasts much longer than wood\n\nEarly uses: Over 5,000 years ago, Chinese people used bamboo to build tree houses . From around 200 BCE to 200 CE , bamboo used in manufacture of paper and books. The more properties discovered about this plant, the more they wanted to use it.\n\nDeveloping applications: Bamboo came inside for use as an interior building material in the 1300s.people used the plant to create bedding and flooring for their homes. bamboo has become as a building material for indoor and outdoor use alike.\n\nMore than furniture: Beginning in the 600s, people used bamboo to make musical instruments. Other cultural uses of bamboo include art inspiration, poetry and music.\n\nBamboo becomes hardwood: In the late 1990s, architects in China developed ways that made bamboo look and feel like hardwood by cutting the bamboo and interlocking it. Curing bamboo can be fun procedure doing it in home. In the beginning drying it is an essential step that will enable us to have an effective output in the end. Also, looking for longer and straighter appearance of the culms is sturdier. Before curing it, we have to remove the infected culms as it can spread. Once these steps are done, we can begin to use the simplest way by grill to cure the bamboo while using a protective glove to avoid getting burned. After that we can maintain its green color by using green eco friendly paint to color it with its green color .\n\nUsed raw local material in creating art:\n\nUsing materials from local or regional sources is considered to be a very good choice for many green designers. Using locally available resources for art help in the protection of environment.\nEvery material delivers something special in the creative progression. the art created from material previously deemed unusable, unwanted, or broken such as bamboo small sticks that used to make shadows and lights and movement is a form of sustainable art that has the potential to have a great attention in the coming years as bamboo combines between lightness, strength, and flexibility with natural beauty . local products materials are often required because they match the aesthetic local designs and can be more durable in the local climate. Also, to build a sense of belonging , an emotional relationship between people and places, use of local materials and products is spirited. This degree of enthusiasm makes people more relaxed at work and has an effect on the well-being of humans. Architects, designers and builders need to confront the troublesome errand of assembly the requirements for modern buildings and structures that are reasonable, secure, sound and beneficial whereas minimizing any negative results for society, the environment and the economy. Beneath the best circumstances, building structures ought to lead to positive comes about in all three areas. The viewer should make sure that the viewer takes a positive message from their art. Now more than ever we stand in need of such messages. Due to the environmental high impact of modern human civilization, the world stands in need of sustainability. artists from all around the world should raise their messages through sustainable art. the technologies and interior designs have been facing \nchallenges due to unsustainable aspects of some building materials. This has put stress on the environment and has also increased use of energy and other degradable resources. On the hindsight, this has also created opportunities for innovative and unconventional resources to emerge by reinventing the traditional building materials and \nusing it in an intelligent way also local products materials are often required because they match the aesthetic local designs and can be more durable in the local climate.",

Where urbanization elevated the demand for housing, deforestation causing high carbon levels to rise significantly. We aim to raise awareness for the Egyptian people to use raw, local materials in their lifestyle even in decorative pieces. From manufacturers perspective the adoption of bamboo material used will expand their scale of operations. Unusually, for bamboo material to be used in a piece of art. So, we made it our purpose to use it and add value for it. The power of bamboo material is sustained from centuries so adding this innovation part we see it will reduce the usage of not eco-friendly material in decorative pieces for instance as plastic colors, and Gibson boards, etc…  \n\nChoosing PVA glue which is water based and it is colorless where is won’t appear as an excess during adherence. Also, it’s not toxic safely used for children and individuals. Additionally, it’s a very strong than any other sustained material and it can join wood together. Further, considering jute “kheish” because it is safe instead of using glass and it is used with the prevailing perspective of eco-friendly materials that operators aims to use more often than any other . Also I chose to use green eco friendly paint to varnish the bamboo and to give a glow to the bamboo colors because I don’t want the brown color of bamboo to be shown hundred precent .",

So, our mission was to innovate idea that will take advantage of this eco-friendly material that is safe, and strong. Additionally, the workers were not aware of the power of bamboo so this will add value and specializations besides the manufacturers have a massive profit from this. Moreover, bamboo contributed in making new work process as follows the farmers will cultivate, smoothing the clumps and deliver it the designers that will transform it to a special piece of art that will be the first to be used with bamboo material. Lastly, the hand-made workers “crafts” they have role of execution which is cutting bamboo into pieces with different thickness and use the executed design. Yet this was a mix between the pharaonic heritage and the bamboo manufacturing in the interior design. Which had brought the sensation of island style inspiration that can fit the Egyptian and non- Egyptian homes. Lastly, we aimed to use the art direction for instance as an eye movement and balance inside the design in a wall art. Thus, the pharaonic heritage was used with a touch of modern art.",
            "q7": "Yes",
            "q8": "The role of bamboo in employment generation :\nThe evolution has increased the productivity of bamboo turning it into water preservation, maintenance of health because it sustains the oxygen level in the atmosphere so it reduces emissions. Additionally, the bamboo contributes in employment of a low skilled labor force specifically from rural regions in Egypt. Therefore, higher labor participation rates in Egypt. Besides the worker characteristics is that they work with handmade crafts with artistic point of views. Thus, more products used with bamboo. The process of bamboo consists of several steps cleaning the bamboo sticks, cutting the twisted branches and smoothening the branch are all prepared manually with a hook which is a primitive tool that is used by the farmers. \n\nFurther, in order to facilitate the steps for the purchaser, transportation and exhibition so we inserted the design in jute “kheish”. This will give the heritage sensation plus the eco-friendly material, this will lessen the effort for the purchaser from the hustle of arranging pieces on wall. Also, considering the Egyptian transparent glue for sustainable and it’s a strong glue that can stick the jute “khiesh” with bamboo.\n\nSo, this will produce a new handmade job that specialized in cutting and forming bamboo with different thickness and layers using this power in transformation through out art pieces.",

            "a2": "Reblox was designed due to the (anthropometry) science to make sure that the applications built by Reblox have met the human body ratios and universal design standards.\n\nFurthermore, to ease the building process, the block was designed to be connected without bonding materials, it is designed with studs and inner ribs to interlock with each other with no need to bonding material, as is customary in traditional red bricks; this saves a lot of time, effort and facilitates the building process\n\nReblox was manufactured out of recyclable and recycled plastic polymers which gave the block a shiny appearance and presence. Surfaces were designed plain and smooth with slightly rounded edges. The appearance is accentuated with solid and transparent colors to accommodate all styles and spatial designs. The plain surfaces allow the user to use adhesive materials like stickers or wallpapers to change the design or style whenever needed. Moreover, Reblox designed the block with an open rooftop and side gates to facilitate any electrical installations.  \n\n The block has many specs and they are as follows:\n1. Sustainability.\nThe block is made out of recycled and recyclable plastic which can save tones of plastic that could have been thrown into oceans and seas. \n\n2. Endurance.\nThe brick is robust enough and heavy duty to last for long, while being flexible enough to be transformed or redesigned continuously.\n\n3. Thermal Resistance.\nReblox has a better thermal resistance factor compared to conventional materials in the market which can save up to 50% of the electricity used for air-conditioning due to its low thermal transmittance value.\n\n4. UV Resistant.\n Reblox resists the ultraviolet rays in the outdoor use which preserves the brick to last for long. \n\n5. Water Resistant.\nPlastic is not a porous material; therefore, it doesn’t absorb water and doesn’t cause any damage when being exposed to humidity.\n\n6. Fire Resistant.\nReblox has developed a grade resistant to fire. This grade doesn’t make ignition by exposing to fire. The grade was tested and certified due to UL94_V0 standard. \n\n7. Strength. \nDue to the compression test, Reblox can bear weight up to 10 kg/cm2. \n\n8. Weight.\nReblox is quite light; it is 10.5 kg/m2 compared to 100kg/m2 in red bricks.",

Since Reblox is made out of recycling and recyclable plastic, it will reduce the waste by turning it into useful product. Besides, it emits zero Co2 during production which reduces the greenhouse gas. \n\nResidential, industrial, administrative and commercial sectors in Egypt consume 79% from the total energy produced. “http://www.moee.gov.eg/test_new/PDFReports/2018-2019AR.pdf p.84”.\nDue to some articles, air conditioners consume around 65% from total electricity. Accordingly, there is a need for thermal resistant walls to reduce the energy consumption for cooling.\n\nReblox walls save up to 15% from the energy consumption for cooling due to the cavity inside the block which works as thermal resistant. Furthermore, Reblox has developed a thermal resistant grade which is filled with foam to reduce the wall thermal transmittance factor (U-value: 0.2w/m2k). It saves around 50% from the energy consumption in cooling compared to red brick walls.\n\nEventually, we can reduce desertification by using Reblox blocks and diminishing the use of the red bricks.\n\n2.

Moreover, \nthe blocks interlock with each other with no bonding materials which eases the building process.\n\nEconomically, Reblox saves money by turning the applications to complete new different ones using the same blocks of the previous application. \n\nOpen studs: Since building walls is a main application, the block was designed with an open studs and side gates to let electrical conduits pass vertically and horizontally. Furthermore, when we install walls, the open studs connect the cavity inside each block with the other ones which increases the air volume inside the wall and makes it one connected volume,  thus reducing the heat transmission because the heat takes times to warm up the whole area of air before being transferred to the other side. By delaying the heat transfer, we reduce the electricity consumed for cooling.\n\nIn addition to that, Reblox has the following specs:\n1. Thermal Resistant grade: Saves up to 50% from the energy consumption in cooling (U-value: 0.2 w/m2k) compared to red bricks. “Energy simulation modeling, Design Builder program”\n2.

No one designed this block with open studs before, however, it solves technical issues and enhances the thermal performance of the block.\n\n3. Inside ribs: the inside ribs let the blocks interlock with each other with no need for bonding material; this makes it easy and simple to use (user friendly).\n\n4.
