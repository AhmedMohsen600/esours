            "a1": "This painting is inspired from the flow of the energy in motion, the contrast of feelings in one event. And how the rollercoaster of energies around you in the environment you live in, affects your emotions and feelings from inside.\n\nThis painting is communicating the negative and positive feelings someone can get. It is represented in the painting through the black and white waves. Black waves represent the negative feelings, ex: envy, jealousy, fear, worry, anger and the white waves represent the positive feelings, ex: peace of mind, love, happiness, hope, excitement, joy, inspiration. \n\nThere is a colored wave, this wave is colored because it represents the flow of the energy in motion. Understanding that emotions are meant to be felt and released and not suppressed and ignored. The need of letting go after feeling each emotion. The power of letting go.",
            "a2": "The idea behind the product is the E-motion,  The representation of the Energy in Motion.\n\nLet’s start by exploring a basic understanding of emotions that will likely be dramatically different than what you have believed up to this point. What we think of as emotion is the experience of energy moving through the body. This is generally felt as sensations of contraction such as tension or expansion such as calm. The Latin derivative for the word emotion, ‘emotere’, literally means energy in motion.\n\nIn itself, emotional energy is neutral. It is the feeling sensation and physiological reaction that makes a specific emotion positive or negative. In the painting it is represented either a negative or positive wave. Feeling is what you label as anger, sadness, joy or fear. It is then your interpretations or thoughts about emotional energy that give it meaning. \n\nEmotion serves as the carrier waves for the entire spectrum of feelings. Understanding that emotions are energy implies that they are fluid, moving resources meant to be felt and released vs. suppressed and ignored. The latter is the true culprit of low emotional intelligence and stress burnout.\n\nAs a result of these findings, the emotional brain is considered to have executive power in the brain. It influences all decision making, thought processes, memories, and present experiences. Your ability to understand, deal with, and effectively use your emotional energy is vital to your happiness levels.\n\nThe sensations you feel in your body hold the key to unlocking limiting patterns, transforming stress, and generating lasting happiness. Your body gives a constant stream of reliable information about your experience in the form of sensation. It’s a library of who you are at the deepest level, including all that has happened to you and all that you dream about. Understanding your body sensations will transform your life\nThe drive to move your emotional energy is present every moment because your nervous system is in constant pursuit of homeostasis. It’s on a mission 24/7 regulating the balance of your bodymind connection. This often includes your instinctual drive to be happy by releasing any pent-up stress. You have an opportunity to move your emotional energy each time you experience contraction, tension, or any other body sensations. They are the internal messages of your bodymind wisdom that draw you toward balance and happiness.\nGiven the understanding that emotion is actually energy in motion it is important to distinguish what it looks and feels like to increase your emotional awareness. Most people believe this looks like using their thinking mind to analyze, think about and talk about how they feel. Although this approach can bring initial awareness it is not effective in the long run. It is common from this approach to hinder the process of expressing and managing emotions. In doing so, it keeps the process of expression at the level of thought vs. actual feeling or energy movement. In order to successfully express emotion you have to move your emotional energy by identifying the sensations and releasing states of contraction.\nThe ability to feel a certain feeling and just move on to the other feeling without overthinking it, let it flow because the second you think about it, it drives from energy in motion to an emotion, then to a thought, then to a spoken word. You never need to underestimate the power of a spoken word.  Death and life are in the power of the tongue and those who love it will eat its fruit. What I am full of, my mouth will say. Speak blessings, your will should be aware that you have power in your words. Words are like seeds, and they grow with you subconsciously like a tree, that will sooner or later produce fruits.  \n\n“Let there be light, and there was light. – God said",

The choice of vibrant colors is intentional to set a bold, inspirational energy to the public intriguing them into learning more about the content of the artwork ie. Egyptian culture. \n\nWith the mission to create an artwork that is not simply a painting hung on the wall but rather a full 3D experience, NL Artworks are hung away from the wall where a space in-between the wall and art emerges.

            "q8": "We need to work with nature rather than against it, learning from nature’s best methods for furthering production not just of materials but of end products. To reach this point, we need to overcome certain presumptions about what our products should look like. We need to pull together some newer production methods, and materials that show promising substitutions. Materials that make us rethink how we make things and what those things could be made of.\n\nIn our profession, it’s very important to work on material research projects. While material science demonstrates the importance of understanding material from all perspectives, it only provides us with only a part of the puzzle. In the end, I think designers should initiate more collaboration. It is their responsibility to speak both languages. Creativity comes from trials and explorations drawn from other fields.  It’s all about having a curiosity to experiment with new things and not to limit yourself to the knowledge you have gained from your field. It is not an easy task to bridge the gap in information and technique. What matters is the process of finding solutions that are meaningful to people, and that enable new ways of understanding, inspiring, and creating a positive impact in society and in our own daily lives. I also think that we shouldn’t focus only on objects and installations but also on the creative process of how something is made.\n\nShell Homage was initiated during my master’s research project, where I was inspired by the aim to reinterpret each material group and communicate their qualities as well as the environmental problems they speak to. I wanted to then, and still do now: create products that have a life span and are able to be returned back to nature when that life span is up. \n\nShell Homage studio offers designed products that are not only intended to provide a basic function, but also an experience that is meaningful and delightful to the user. I want to stir emotional and intellectual curiosities within consumers. I propose a new way to look at “shells”, and in doing so I hope to reveal this material’s personal homage. \nI hope my work will inspire others to do something out of food waste as well. There is so much to do in the world of food, since it’s one of the biggest industries on earth! I think a lot of creativity is needed to address those things. A designer can be the activist and the cause for change. He or she must be innovative in spirit, seeking out collaborators to reach amazing solutions which outperform and offer truly viable alternatives to current approaches. The pursuit is to be in full control of the lifespan of the product, from its origin – in the form of natural material – through to the final product until its inescapable decay.",

Today the Mesquita de Cordoba (Cordoba Mosque) as it is commonly known by (The Cordoba Cathedral)\nThe Mihrab design in my application, is not the original Mihrab of the Cordoba mosque, but it is inspired by a design from one of the entrance gates of the mosque.\nThere are 3 main entrance gates dating back to Moorish construction.\nAbove the gate there is a decorative arch wall panel consist of 5 horseshoe arches combined together.\nIn my design I simplify these 5 arches into 1 horseshoe arch frame with its biomorphic designs (Nabati Pattern – plants and florals) and in the middle is a beautiful ceramic mosaic wall with the famous swastikas' design with the nature colors of the raw materials of the place. \nIt is a way to reborn our Islamic art, that has been abandoned and excluded, and create from it a unique piece to our tradional art into our homes and residents. \nIt can be used as a Mihrab for Muslim prayers OR as a mirror frame without the swastikas' design, for commercial use.\nThe steps of making my Wall Panel product (Mezquita Mihrab)\n-I will be using traditional techniques by cutting and carving local clay while it’s still soft\n1-\tChoose the monument that inspired me and draw its geometric pattern by the exact ratio size, related to our universe and biomorphic pattern.\n2-\tPrepare the clay to use by folding it into a straight form and cut the pieces upon to the geometric design to form the tiles. (* The piece should not exceed that 25cm to stay at its flat shape.)\n3-\tTrace the biomorphic design on the soft clay tiles and starting the carving stage of each tile.\n4-\tMake plaster or rubber molds of the carved tiles to do the opposite side and to create more in the future with less effort and cost.\n5-\tCut the inner part of the Mihrab by square pieces to form the (zelig – Moroccan / Andalusia tile tradional technique) is a similar to mosaic tiles.\n6-\tKeep all pieces to dry away in direct sunlight (from 7-10 days depends on the weather)\n7-\tCook the tiles in the kiln, fire on 850-degree C and the refine all pieces with sand paper to form the pattern without any gaps\n8-\tMake glazes chemical trials on unused pieces. When we reach the desired color, apply it to all the handmade tiles of the mihrab.\n9-\tFire the glaze on a 1050-degree C\n10-\tAfter fire and when it is cooled down, it’s time to gather the pieces together and wood frame it for the final product to use.\n11-\tFor mirror add a mirror in the middle and gather only the frame \n12-\tFor wall fountain add a water tub from ceramic or copper and a handmade sink.",

We use locally sourced clay as the raw material.\nOne of the best qualities about ceramics is that they are truly a natural product. Ceramics all start with clay, which is a naturally malleable material composed of minerals and water.\nThe mineral bodies in ceramic clay are abundant and sourced from the earth, next to the banks of river Nile or from special desert places. We create products that are handmade, shaped and carved by hand and drawing underglaze and over glaze. When fired in a kiln, it can last a lifetime or longer. (Ceramic and Pottery from Pharaonic, Coptic and Islamic ancestors are still standing till now). Both natural and food-safe, ceramic dinnerware, tiles, tray is significantly more sustainable than plastics, the latter can actually leak toxins into the food we eat and water we drink.\nThe ceramic industry has, for many years, performed important technological and managerial improvements to tackle environmental aspects of the manufacturing phase. Ceramic tiles can be crushed and then used in a range of different applications, like concrete aggregates or road construction, turning the waste become a resource.\nOur products are environmentally-friendly throughout their manufacturing process.\nWe use more natural resources, in a way they last indefinitely, we use natural Aswan clay and chemicals for colors above it a glaze material which is very safe for use burned in a very high temperature to insure safety and strong tiles.\n We offer elegant pieces which are made using sustainable production methods with respect for both the environment and the artists who create them. They do not contain harmful chemicals like cadmium or lead. \nWe are proud to announce that all of our glazes are food-safe, lead-free\nNatural mineral clay is an excellent resource for creating beautiful, safe and sustainable pieces you can feel good about using in your home.",

Since the day this world is created, different centuries of art and history have came through with each phase having it’s own unbelievable story that made us who we are today. Letting these stories fade hinders our development. That’s why I decided to bring them to life in a way that copes with the present.\nA legendary touch from the past blends with the new art creating this exceptional piece that tells a-lot.\n\n639 CE until the brief end of the 16th century marked the great Islamic era which was led by Amr Ibn el As on Egypt. \nThis era was a great transformation in the Egyptian history and it lies between the two alternative dynasties that together formed the great and magnificent Egyptian history. This era was one in which Egypt cast off the heritage of the past to embrace a new culture in which Egyptian Islamic civilization evolved. During that period Egypt was part of a great world empire. \n\nMy product is a one that glorifies and praises the great Islamic era.

            "a2": "It all started with a college trip to omar ebn el as mosque, I kept staring at the dome and the inner lighting units for hours. I went home and started to research about the islamic empire, how they dressed, the colors they use, the patterns and the products they created for living.\n\nAfter tons of researches and sleepless nights my gallery was filled with astonishing mosques, architectures, kilim carpets, outfits of rulers and loads of potteries. With one common element which was fine smooth curves with hints of blue, it took me few seconds to research why blue? Then I realised that books were created explaining the reason behind it. It was proven that blue is the sign of cleanness and spirituality back then. In the architecture of Islamic mosques the colors blue and turquois blue are used abundantly. The traditional people believed in the holiness of turquoise blue. They integrated blue within almost each and every piece. \n\nWhile brainstorming my product that will speak out this story I decided to add a hint of turquoise blue making it  one of my primary colors in my color palette. And because Water is what makes us humans, water bottle was my inspiration to create my story.\n\nGlass is aesthetically appealing material made out of sand, hygiene substance created out of raw material, reusable and recyclable well know with it’s transparency, dust resistance and color availability. \nIt is the best match for water and to be placed in interiors including homes. \n\n60% of the human body is water, water defines us, it creates the body shape. the soothing water waves that is created when the water is poured in a flask or a cup is another feature that I wanted to add in my design. the perfect curved waves that are created resemble the human body’s curves and spirality, these when added to my design create a remarkable perspective. and that’s together with the nude effect and water blue are elements that I wanted to integrate in my product. \nAfter gathering enough knowledge to start, I decided to design a water bottle out of glass. While adding inspirations from the islamic art as the cap that was inspired from the sultans hats during this era in addition to hint of turquoise blue to compliment the water effect. Also it’s shape is inspired from the water potteries and it has curves that remains people of the human body creation.\n\nIt took two weeks of hard work and insistence along with excitement to define the final shape, I started by adding a tracing papers into my sketchbook and started to recreate the lines till I felt this shape was the most suitable one. After that I created a mood board using the colors I previously mentioned and the vibes I wanted to deliver. Then I took my design and started to 3D model my product into ratio of 1:1 in rhino 3D and renders in keyshot.

Knowing that made me insist more to make my design a handcrafted one. I went to gamaleya street and I met with one of the glassblowers, I showed him the design I have created and surprisingly he implemented it without any flaws. It was a piece of art. I was astonished. The way he takes control of the glass and shapes it before the glass cools under a curtain temperature is an innovation that I would like it to keep living on.
