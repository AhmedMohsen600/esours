And how the rollercoaster of energies around you in the environment you live in, affects your emotions and feelings from inside.\\n\\nThis painting is communicating the negative and positive feelings someone can get. It is represented in the painting through the black and white waves. Black waves represent the negative feelings, ex: envy, jealousy, fear, worry, anger and the white waves represent the positive feelings, ex: peace of mind, love, happiness, hope, excitement, joy, inspiration. \\n\\nThere is a colored wave, this wave is colored because it represents the flow of the energy in motion. Understanding that emotions are meant to be felt and released and not suppressed and ignored. The need of letting go after feeling each emotion. The power of letting go.","a2":"The idea behind the product is the E-motion,  The representation of the Energy in Motion.\\n\\nLet\u2019s start by exploring a basic understanding of emotions that will likely be dramatically different than what you have believed up to this point. What we think of as emotion is the experience of energy moving through the body. This is generally felt as sensations of contraction such as tension or expansion such as calm. The Latin derivative for the word emotion, \u2018emotere\u2019, literally means energy in motion.\\n\\nIn itself, emotional energy is neutral. It is the feeling sensation and physiological reaction that makes a specific emotion positive or negative. In the painting it is represented either a negative or positive wave. Feeling is what you label as anger, sadness, joy or fear. It is then your interpretations or thoughts about emotional energy that give it meaning. \\n\\nEmotion serves as the carrier waves for the entire spectrum of feelings. Understanding that emotions are energy implies that they are fluid, moving resources meant to be felt and released vs. suppressed and ignored. The latter is the true culprit of low emotional intelligence and stress burnout.\\n\\nAs a result of these findings, the emotional brain is considered to have executive power in the brain. It influences all decision making, thought processes, memories, and present experiences. Your ability to understand, deal with, and effectively use your emotional energy is vital to your happiness levels.\\n\\nThe sensations you feel in your body hold the key to unlocking limiting patterns, transforming stress, and generating lasting happiness. Your body gives a constant stream of reliable information about your experience in the form of sensation. It\u2019s a library of who you are at the deepest level, including all that has happened to you and all that you dream about. Understanding your body sensations will transform your life\\nThe drive to move your emotional energy is present every moment because your nervous system is in constant pursuit of homeostasis. It\u2019s on a mission 24/7 regulating the balance of your bodymind connection. This often includes your instinctual drive to be happy by releasing any pent-up stress. You have an opportunity to move your emotional energy each time you experience contraction, tension, or any other body sensations. They are the internal messages of your bodymind wisdom that draw you toward balance and happiness.\\nGiven the understanding that emotion is actually energy in motion it is important to distinguish what it looks and feels like to increase your emotional awareness. Most people believe this looks like using their thinking mind to analyze, think about and talk about how they feel. Although this approach can bring initial awareness it is not effective in the long run. It is common from this approach to hinder the process of expressing and managing emotions. In doing so, it keeps the process of expression at the level of thought vs. actual feeling or energy movement. In order to successfully express emotion you have to move your emotional energy by identifying the sensations and releasing states of contraction.\\nThe ability to feel a certain feeling and just move on to the other feeling without overthinking it, let it flow because the second you think about it, it drives from energy in motion to an emotion, then to a thought, then to a spoken word. You never need to underestimate the power of a spoken word.  Death and life are in the power of the tongue and those who love it will eat its fruit. What I am full of, my mouth will say. Speak blessings, your will should be aware that you have power in your words. Words are like seeds, and they grow with you subconsciously like a tree, that will sooner or later produce fruits.  \\n\\n\u201cLet there be light, and there was light. \u2013 God said","q1":"Yes","q2":"The paintings are made from acrylic on canvas.

Shell Homage studio offers designed products that are intended to create an experience that is meaningful and delightful to users of each product and not only to provide a basic function. The created material replace oil based plastics, non toxic and completely biodegradable.","q3":"Yes","q4":"the aim of Shell Homage is to create functional and sustainable products that have a life span, yet are able to completely biodegrade at the end of their life, shells and natural fillers such as egg seem to me to be worthy material choices to explore further. By using these kinds of materials, no toxic chemicals are needed to produce a viable product. That means that when you decide that you don\u2019t need it anymore, the product can be dipped into your garden and left to naturally decay. \\n\\nI see it as the ultimate solution for \u201cgetting rid of things\u201d. Instead of \u201cstoring\u201d them or having the earth \u201cstore\u201d them for years and years, these materials will decay naturally, offering an alternative to standard plastics, which as we know, never decay!\\n\\nThe objects and materials I have developed also have another aim\u2026\\nThey aspire to start a conversation, educate and enlighten us on how they\u2019ve been made and whom they\u2019ve been made by.

I want people to question why certain ingredients are used. I want to inspire curiosity and a desire to choose healthier alternatives.","q5":"Yes","q6":"Indeed, a growing effort has arisen to use bio-fillers as a replacement for synthetic ones in an attempt to reduce the cost. Eggshell is a strong bio-filler candidate since it contains high percentages of CaCO3, which exists in bulk quantity and is inexpensive. \\n\\nMoreover, the integral components of eggshell enables the reduction of shrinkage during molding, enhances stiffness and flammability resistance of the biopolymers used.\\nThe idea behind Shell Homage is to work with biopolymers and natural fillers, experiment with the unexpected influences of these materials, and explore different ways of producing materials, from high-tech processing techniques to the handmade.","q7":"Yes","q8":"We need to work with nature rather than against it, learning from nature\u2019s best methods for furthering production not just of materials but of end products. To reach this point, we need to overcome certain presumptions about what our products should look like. We need to pull together some newer production methods, and materials that show promising substitutions. Materials that make us rethink how we make things and what those things could be made of.\\n\\nIn our profession, it\u2019s very important to work on material research projects. While material science demonstrates the importance of understanding material from all perspectives, it only provides us with only a part of the puzzle. In the end, I think designers should initiate more collaboration. It is their responsibility to speak both languages. Creativity comes from trials and explorations drawn from other fields.  It\u2019s all about having a curiosity to experiment with new things and not to limit yourself to the knowledge you have gained from your field. It is not an easy task to bridge the gap in information and technique. What matters is the process of finding solutions that are meaningful to people, and that enable new ways of understanding, inspiring, and creating a positive impact in society and in our own daily lives. I also think that we shouldn\u2019t focus only on objects and installations but also on the creative process of how something is made.\\n\\nShell Homage was initiated during my master\u2019s research project, where I was inspired by the aim to reinterpret each material group and communicate their qualities as well as the environmental problems they speak to. I wanted to then, and still do now: create products that have a life span and are able to be returned back to nature when that life span is up. \\n\\nShell Homage studio offers designed products that are not only intended to provide a basic function, but also an experience that is meaningful and delightful to the user. I want to stir emotional and intellectual curiosities within consumers. I propose a new way to look at \u201cshells\u201d, and in doing so I hope to reveal this material\u2019s personal homage. \\nI hope my work will inspire others to do something out of food waste as well. There is so much to do in the world of food, since it\u2019s one of the biggest industries on earth! I think a lot of creativity is needed to address those things. A designer can be the activist and the cause for change. He or she must be innovative in spirit, seeking out collaborators to reach amazing solutions which outperform and offer truly viable alternatives to current approaches. The pursuit is to be in full control of the lifespan of the product, from its origin \u2013 in the form of natural material \u2013 through to the final product until its inescapable decay.","img":"https://esorus.com/uploads/dynamic-form/image/2021/10/25683.jpeg","images":["https://esorus.com/uploads/dynamic-form/image/2021/10/25683.jpeg","https://esorus.com/uploads/dynamic-form/image/2021/10/25684.jpeg","https://esorus.com/uploads/dynamic-form/image/2021/10/25686.jpeg","https://esorus.com/uploads/dynamic-form/image/2021/10/25687.jpeg","https://esorus.com/uploads/dynamic-form/image/2021/10/25688.jpeg","https://esorus.com/uploads/dynamic-form/image/2021/10/25689.jpeg","https://esorus.com/uploads/dynamic-form/image/2021/10/25690.jpeg","https://esorus.com/uploads/dynamic-form/image/2021/10/25691.jpeg","https://esorus.com/uploads/dynamic-form/image/2021/10/25692.jpeg","https://esorus.com/uploads/dynamic-form/image/2021/10/25693.jpeg"],"categories":["Materials"]},{"id":29869,"productName":"Beanbag

was inspired by the ornamental icon of the ancient pharaoh (the scarab). And because the ancient\\nEgyptians believed that they carried amulets for a scarab that would protect them from evil, as there were many interpretations\\nand gossip about the scarab from it (it drags a ball around, simulate the movement of the sun from east to west).

And how the rollercoaster of energies around you in the environment you live in, affects your emotions and feelings from inside.\\n\\nThis painting is communicating the negative and positive feelings someone can get. It is represented in the painting through the black and white waves. Black waves represent the negative feelings, ex: envy, jealousy, fear, worry, anger and the white waves represent the positive feelings, ex: peace of mind, love, happiness, hope, excitement, joy, inspiration. \\n\\nThere is a colored wave, this wave is colored because it represents the flow of the energy in motion. Understanding that emotions are meant to be felt and released and not suppressed and ignored. The need of letting go after feeling each emotion. The power of letting go.","Submission Form/About the product development & research (rational/ morphology)":"The idea behind the product is the E-motion,  The representation of the Energy in Motion.\\n\\nLet\u2019s start by exploring a basic understanding of emotions that will likely be dramatically different than what you have believed up to this point. What we think of as emotion is the experience of energy moving through the body. This is generally felt as sensations of contraction such as tension or expansion such as calm. The Latin derivative for the word emotion, \u2018emotere\u2019, literally means energy in motion.\\n\\nIn itself, emotional energy is neutral. It is the feeling sensation and physiological reaction that makes a specific emotion positive or negative. In the painting it is represented either a negative or positive wave. Feeling is what you label as anger, sadness, joy or fear. It is then your interpretations or thoughts about emotional energy that give it meaning. \\n\\nEmotion serves as the carrier waves for the entire spectrum of feelings. Understanding that emotions are energy implies that they are fluid, moving resources meant to be felt and released vs. suppressed and ignored. The latter is the true culprit of low emotional intelligence and stress burnout.\\n\\nAs a result of these findings, the emotional brain is considered to have executive power in the brain. It influences all decision making, thought processes, memories, and present experiences. Your ability to understand, deal with, and effectively use your emotional energy is vital to your happiness levels.\\n\\nThe sensations you feel in your body hold the key to unlocking limiting patterns, transforming stress, and generating lasting happiness. Your body gives a constant stream of reliable information about your experience in the form of sensation. It\u2019s a library of who you are at the deepest level, including all that has happened to you and all that you dream about. Understanding your body sensations will transform your life\\nThe drive to move your emotional energy is present every moment because your nervous system is in constant pursuit of homeostasis. It\u2019s on a mission 24/7 regulating the balance of your bodymind connection. This often includes your instinctual drive to be happy by releasing any pent-up stress. You have an opportunity to move your emotional energy each time you experience contraction, tension, or any other body sensations. They are the internal messages of your bodymind wisdom that draw you toward balance and happiness.\\nGiven the understanding that emotion is actually energy in motion it is important to distinguish what it looks and feels like to increase your emotional awareness. Most people believe this looks like using their thinking mind to analyze, think about and talk about how they feel. Although this approach can bring initial awareness it is not effective in the long run. It is common from this approach to hinder the process of expressing and managing emotions. In doing so, it keeps the process of expression at the level of thought vs. actual feeling or energy movement. In order to successfully express emotion you have to move your emotional energy by identifying the sensations and releasing states of contraction.\\nThe ability to feel a certain feeling and just move on to the other feeling without overthinking it, let it flow because the second you think about it, it drives from energy in motion to an emotion, then to a thought, then to a spoken word. You never need to underestimate the power of a spoken word.  Death and life are in the power of the tongue and those who love it will eat its fruit. What I am full of, my mouth will say. Speak blessings, your will should be aware that you have power in your words. Words are like seeds, and they grow with you subconsciously like a tree, that will sooner or later produce fruits.  \\n\\n\u201cLet there be light, and there was light. \u2013 God said\u201d","Submission Form/Does this product tackle the \\"Sustainability\\" criteria?":"Yes","Submission Form/How is the criteria fulfilled?

(max 200 words)":"Shell Homage studio experiments with unusual materials that appear to be quite different in properties, behavior, and composition as eggshells, cacao shells and the outer shells of nuts, unusual applications and products are designed. The resulted biodegradable composites are applied in creating a wide range of products that not only meet the functional requirements but also inspires a sense of emotions and intellectual curiosities to consumers. It\u2019s a new way to look at \u201cshells\u201d, reveal its personal homage. Shell Homage studio offers designed products that are intended to create an experience that is meaningful and delightful to users of each product and not only to provide a basic function. The created material replace oil based plastics, non toxic and completely biodegradable.","Submission Form/Does this product tackle the \\"Functionality\\" criteria?":"Yes","Submission Form/How is the criteria fulfilled? (max 200 words)__1":"the aim of Shell Homage is to create functional and sustainable products that have a life span, yet are able to completely biodegrade at the end of their life, shells and natural fillers such as egg seem to me to be worthy material choices to explore further. By using these kinds of materials, no toxic chemicals are needed to produce a viable product. That means that when you decide that you don\u2019t need it anymore, the product can be dipped into your garden and left to naturally decay. \\n\\nI see it as the ultimate solution for \u201cgetting rid of things\u201d. Instead of \u201cstoring\u201d them or having the earth \u201cstore\u201d them for years and years, these materials will decay naturally, offering an alternative to standard plastics, which as we know, never decay!\\n\\nThe objects and materials I have developed also have another aim\u2026\\nThey aspire to start a conversation, educate and enlighten us on how they\u2019ve been made and whom they\u2019ve been made by. By using unexpected ingredients and experimenting with different methods of making, I hope that these materials make us enquire more about the ingredients in our products. I want people to question why certain ingredients are used. I want to inspire curiosity and a desire to choose healthier alternatives.","Submission Form/Does this product tackle the \\"Innovation\\" criteria?":"Yes","Submission Form/How is the criteria fulfilled? (max 200 words)__2":"Indeed, a growing effort has arisen to use bio-fillers as a replacement for synthetic ones in an attempt to reduce the cost. Eggshell is a strong bio-filler candidate since it contains high percentages of CaCO3, which exists in bulk quantity and is inexpensive. \\n\\nMoreover, the integral components of eggshell enables the reduction of shrinkage during molding, enhances stiffness and flammability resistance of the biopolymers used.\\nThe idea behind Shell Homage is to work with biopolymers and natural fillers, experiment with the unexpected influences of these materials, and explore different ways of producing materials, from high-tech processing techniques to the handmade.","Submission Form/Does this product tackle the \\"Feasibility\\" criteria?":"Yes","Submission Form/How is the criteria fulfilled? (max 200 words)__3":"We need to work with nature rather than against it, learning from nature\u2019s best methods for furthering production not just of materials but of end products. To reach this point, we need to overcome certain presumptions about what our products should look like. We need to pull together some newer production methods, and materials that show promising substitutions. Materials that make us rethink how we make things and what those things could be made of.\\n\\nIn our profession, it\u2019s very important to work on material research projects. While material science demonstrates the importance of understanding material from all perspectives, it only provides us with only a part of the puzzle. In the end, I think designers should initiate more collaboration. It is their responsibility to speak both languages. Creativity comes from trials and explorations drawn from other fields.  It\u2019s all about having a curiosity to experiment with new things and not to limit yourself to the knowledge you have gained from your field. It is not an easy task to bridge the gap in information and technique. What matters is the process of finding solutions that are meaningful to people, and that enable new ways of understanding, inspiring, and creating a positive impact in society and in our own daily lives. I also think that we shouldn\u2019t focus only on objects and installations but also on the creative process of how something is made.\\n\\nShell Homage was initiated during my master\u2019s research project, where I was inspired by the aim to reinterpret each material group and communicate their qualities as well as the environmental problems they speak to. I wanted to then, and still do now: create products that have a life span and are able to be returned back to nature when that life span is up. \\n\\nShell Homage studio offers designed products that are not only intended to provide a basic function, but also an experience that is meaningful and delightful to the user. I want to stir emotional and intellectual curiosities within consumers. I propose a new way to look at \u201cshells\u201d, and in doing so I hope to reveal this material\u2019s personal homage. \\nI hope my work will inspire others to do something out of food waste as well. There is so much to do in the world of food, since it\u2019s one of the biggest industries on earth! I think a lot of creativity is needed to address those things. A designer can be the activist and the cause for change. He or she must be innovative in spirit, seeking out collaborators to reach amazing solutions which outperform and offer truly viable alternatives to current approaches. The pursuit is to be in full control of the lifespan of the product, from its origin \u2013 in the form of natural material \u2013 through to the final product until its inescapable decay.","category":"Materials"},{"id":29869,"Progress %":"100%","Created":"25/09/2021 11:02 PM","userName":"Mina Thomas","userPhone":1003787940,"userEmail":"mena.thms@gmail.com","productName":"Beanbag Rocker BBR","img":"https://esorus.com/uploads/dynamic-form/image/2021/09/25614.jpeg\\nhttps://esorus.com/uploads/dynamic-form/image/2021/09/25615.jpeg\\nhttps://esorus.com/uploads/dynamic-form/image/2021/09/25616.jpeg\\nhttps://esorus.com/uploads/dynamic-form/image/2021/09/25617.jpeg\\nhttps://esorus.com/uploads/dynamic-form/image/2021/09/25618.jpeg\\nhttps://esorus.com/uploads/dynamic-form/image/2021/09/25619.jpeg\\nhttps://esorus.com/uploads/dynamic-form/image/2021/09/25620.jpeg\\nhttps://esorus.com/uploads/dynamic-form/image/2021/09/25621.jpeg","Submission Form/Note of intention/ philosophy (what the designer is trying to solve, the idea behind the product)":"BBR is a product that will turn your beanbag into a rocking chair, \\nit combines the coziness of a beanbag, with the relaxing gentle motion of a rocking chair , resulting in a whole new user experience.\\nThe product is a complementary base, consisting of 4 wooden pieces with simple joinery.\\n\\nEasy to assemble\\nEasy to store.\\nLightweight\\nfits to standard beanbag","Submission Form/About the product development & research (rational/ morphology)":"I started researching beanbags that can rock, and I found a couple of cool products, only thing is the rocking bean bag is sold as a whole unit, and the rocking base can\'t be sold separately.\\nI started sketching and thinking out few concepts.\\nMy approach was to come up with a composition that combines relaxation of a rocking chair, with comfort of a beanbag.\\nThe design must produce easily, and must fit to a standard beanbag.\\n\\nMy main concern was to minimize the production process as well as the quantity of material waste.\\nI decided to use CNC Routing machine, and plywood with simple joinery for my design.\\nso once I came up with a clear form, I started modeling for prototyping using cad software. \\nI spent some time calculating the capacity of plywood sheet and different layouts and solutions, \\nto reduce waste and maximize the number of products per sheet.\\n\\nLater I decided making some edits including: \\n- narrowing the two upper parts and by doing so, it left a space for two more products per sheet. \\n- adding a finger grip\\n- made the joining slots more curvy for much easier and faster assembly.\\n\\nI used 14mm mdf for 1:1 scale prototype, and the result was great.\\nI\'ve been testing it at my home for a couple of weeks, to see the rocking and balance, and \\nto check if there was any further improvements.","Submission Form/Does this product tackle the \\"Sustainability\\" criteria?":"Yes","Submission Form/How is the criteria fulfilled?

It was proven that blue is the sign of cleanness and spirituality back then. In the architecture of Islamic mosques the colors blue and turquois blue are used abundantly. The traditional people believed in the holiness of turquoise blue. They integrated blue within almost each and every piece. \\n\\nWhile brainstorming my product that will speak out this story I decided to add a hint of turquoise blue making it  one of my primary colors in my color palette.
